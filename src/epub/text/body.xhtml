<p class="noindent"><span class="sc">I have been asked</span> to write an explanatory preface to
these Memoirs, on the occasion of their first appearance
in a single volume. The first volume was begun in
October 1926 and completed eighteen months later.
The second volume was begun in December 1928 and
completed in April 1930. The third volume, completed
in January 1936, was written in four months. These
details are all I can offer the reader of this volume.
From the first word to the last I have tried to make
these Memoirs explain themselves as they go along.
No further explanations are possible, or, in my opinion,
necessary.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y</span> childhood was a queer and not altogether
happy one. Circumstances conspired
to make me shy and solitary. My father
and mother died before I was capable of remembering
them. I was an only child, entrusted to the
care of an unmarried aunt who lived quietly in the
country. My aunt was no longer young when I
began to live in her comfortable, old-fashioned
house with its large, untidy garden. She had settled
down to her local interests, seldom had anyone
to stay with her, and rarely left home. She was
fond of her two Persian cats, busied herself sensibly
with her garden, and was charitably interested
in the old and rheumatic inhabitants of the village.
Beyond this, the radius of her activities extended
no further than the eight or ten miles which she
could cover in a four-wheeled dog-cart driven by
Tom Dixon, the groom. The rest of the world was
what she described as ‘beyond calling distance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon was a smart young man who would have
preferred a livelier situation. It was he who persuaded
my aunt to buy me my first pony. I was
then nine years old.</p>

<p class="pindent">My aunt had an unexplained prejudice against
sending me to school. So I remained at home until
I was twelve—inefficiently tutored by a retired
elementary schoolmaster, a gentle, semi-clerical old
person who arrived every morning, taught me a
limited supply of Latin, and bowled lobs to me on
the lawn. His name (which I have not thought of
for I don’t know how many years) was Mr. Star.</p>

<p class="pindent">Apart from my aunt’s efforts to bring me up
nicely, my early education was exclusively controlled
by Mr. Star and Dixon, who supplemented
Mr. Star’s lobs with his more intimidating overarm
bowling, and never lost sight of his intention to
make a sportsman of me. For the vaguely apologetic
old tutor in his black tail-coat I felt a tolerant
affection. But it was Dixon who taught me to
ride, and my admiration for him was unqualified.
And since he was what I afterwards learnt to call
‘a perfect gentleman’s servant,’ he never allowed
me to forget my position as ‘a little gentleman’:
he always knew exactly when to become discreetly
respectful. In fact, he ‘knew his place.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I have said that my childhood was not altogether
a happy one. This must have been caused by the
absence of companions of my own age. My Aunt
Evelyn—who was full of common sense and liked
people (children included) to be practical in their
habits and behaviour—used to complain to Mr.
Star that I was too fond of mooning aimlessly
about by myself. On my eighth birthday she gave
me a butterfly-net and a fretwork saw, but these
suggestions were unfruitful. Now and again she
took me to a children’s party given by one of the
local gentry: at such functions I was awkward and
uncomfortable, and something usually happened
which increased my sense of inferiority to the other
children, who were better at everything than I was
and made no attempt to assist me out of my shyness.
I had no friends of my own age. I was
strictly forbidden to ‘associate’ with the village
boys. And even the sons of the neighbouring
farmers were considered ‘unsuitable’—though I
was too shy and nervous to speak to them.</p>

<p class="pindent">I do not blame my aunt for this. She was
merely conforming to her social code which divided
the world into people whom one could ‘call on’
and people who were ‘socially impossible.’ She
was mistaken, perhaps, in applying this code to a
small, solitary boy like myself. But the world was
less democratic in those days, and it must not be
thought that I received any active unkindness from
Aunt Evelyn, who was tender-hearted and easygoing.</p>

<p class="pindent">As a consequence of my loneliness I created in
my childish day-dreams an ideal companion who
became much more of a reality than such unfriendly
boys as I encountered at Christmas parties. (I remember
a party given by my aunt, in the course of
which one of my ‘little friends’ contrived to lock
me in a cupboard during a game of hide-and-seek.
And, to tell the truth, I was so glad to escape from
the horrors of my own hospitality that I kept as
quiet as a mouse for the best part of an hour,
crouching on the floor of that camphor-smelling
cupboard.) The ‘ideal companion’ probably
originated in my desire for an elder brother. When
I began these reminiscences I did not anticipate
that I should be describing such an apparently
trivial episode—and I doubt whether such a thing
can be called an episode at all—but among a multitude
of blurred memories, my ‘dream friend’
has cropped up with an odd effect of importance
which makes me feel that he must be worth a passing
mention. The fact is that, as soon as I began
to picture in my mind the house and garden where
I spent so much of my early life, I caught sight of
my small, long-vanished self with this other non-existent
boy standing beside him. And, though it
sounds silly enough, I felt queerly touched by the
recollection of that forgotten companionship. For
some reason which I cannot explain, the presence
of that ‘other boy’ made my childhood unexpectedly
clear, and brought me close to a number of
things which, I should have thought, would have
faded for ever. For instance, I have only just remembered
the tarnished mirror which used to hang
in the sunless passage which led to my schoolroom,
and how, when I secretly stared at my small, white
face in this mirror, I could hear the sparrows
chirping in the ivy which grew thickly outside the
windows. Somehow the sight of my own reflection
increased my loneliness, till the voice of my
aunt speaking to one of the servants on the stairs
made me start guiltily away.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, as I look up from my writing, these
memories also seem like reflections in a glass, reflections
which are becoming more and more easy
to distinguish. Sitting here, alone with my slowly
moving thoughts, I rediscover many little details,
known only to myself, details otherwise dead and
forgotten with all who shared that time; and I am
inclined to loiter among them as long as possible.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ow</span> that I come to think about it, it seems to
me to be quite on the cards, that, had my
Aunt Evelyn employed an unpretentious groom-gardener
(who would really have suited her original
requirements far better than jaunty young Dixon)
I should never have earned the right to call myself
a fox-hunting man. Dixon’s predecessor was a
stolid old coachman who disliked riding. One of
my earliest recollections is the advent of Dixon,
who lost no time in persuading my aunt to pension
off her pair of worn-out carriage horses, which he
replaced by two comparatively juvenile animals
‘warranted quiet to ride or drive.’ Dixon dearly
loved to do a deal, and my aunt was amenable to
his influence. She even went so far as to sanction
the purchase of a side-saddle, and although a
timid and incompetent horsewoman, she came to
the conclusion that riding was good for her health.
Two or three times a week, then, on fine days,
shepherded by the dignified and respectful groom,
she was to be seen ambling along the lanes in a
badly cut brown habit. She never attended a
meet of the hounds however, for we lived in an
unhunted part of the country, and the nearest
meet was more than eight miles away.</p>

<p class="pindent">So far as I was concerned, for several years ‘the
hounds’ remained a remote and mysteriously important
rumour, continually talked about by
Dixon, who never ceased to regret the remoteness
of their activities. Foxes were few in our part
of the country, and the farmers made no secret of
shooting them. In fact ours was a thoroughly
unsporting neighbourhood. There wasn’t so much
as a pack of beagles in the district. But Dixon
was deeply imbued with sporting instincts. From
the age of fourteen he had worked in stables, and
had even shared, for a few months, the early rising
rigours of a racing-stable. He had been ‘odd
man’ to a sporting farmer in the Vale of Aylesbury,
and had spent three years as under-groom
to a hard-riding squire who subscribed handsomely
to Lord Dumborough’s Hounds. Dumborough
Park was twelve miles from where my
aunt lived, and in those days twelve miles meant a
lot, from a social point of view. My aunt was
fully two miles beyond the radius of Lady Dumborough’s
‘round of calls.’ Those two miles
made all the difference, and the aristocratic yellow-wheeled
barouche never entered our unassuming
white gate. I never heard my aunt express
any regret for her topographical exclusion from
the centre of county society. But for Dixon it
was one of the lesser tragedies of life; he would
have given anything to be able to drive ‘the mistress’
over to Dumborough Park now and again,
for the Kennels were there, and to him the Kennels
were the centre of the local universe. As it
was, he had to be content with a few garden-parties,
where he could hob-nob with a crowd of garrulous
grooms, and perhaps get a few words with
that great man, Lord Dumborough’s head coachman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nevertheless, as the slow seasons of my childhood
succeeded one another, he rattled my aunt
along the roads in her four-wheeled dog-cart at
an increasingly lively pace. He must have been
very adroit in his management of my gentle relative
and guardian, since he perpetually found some
plausible excuse for getting rid of one of the
horses. Invariably, and by gentle gradations
toward his ideal ‘stamp of hunter,’ he replaced
each criticizable quadruped with one that looked
more like galloping and jumping. The scope of
these manœuvrings was, of course, restricted by
my aunt’s refusal to pay more than a certain price
for a horse, but Dixon always had his eyes open
for a possible purchase from any sporting farmer
or country gentleman within riding distance; he
also assiduously studied the advertisements of
the London horse-sales, and when he had finally
established his supremacy ‘the mistress’ unprotestingly
gave him permission to ‘go up to Tattersalls,’
whence he would return, sedately triumphant,
accompanied by the kindly countenance of what
he called ‘a perfect picture of an old-fashioned
sort.’ (A ‘sort,’ as I afterwards learned, was a
significant word in the vocabulary of hunting-men.)</p>

<p class="pindent">How vividly I remember Dixon’s keen-featured
face, as he proudly paraded his latest purchase on
the gravel in front of the house, or cantered it
round the big paddock at the back of the stables,
while my aunt and I watched, from a safe distance,
the not infrequent symptoms of a sprightliness not
altogether to her taste.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, ’m,” he would say, in his respectful voice,
as he pulled up and leant forward to clap the neck
of the loudly snorting animal, “I think this mare’ll
suit you down to the ground.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fling you to the ground’ would, in one or two
cases, have been a more accurate prophecy, as
Aunt Evelyn may have secretly surmised while
she nervously patted the ‘new carriage horse’
which was waltzing around its owner and her
small nephew! And there was, indeed, one regrettable
occasion, when a good-looking but suspiciously
cheap newcomer (bought at Tattersalls
without a warrant) decided to do his best to demolish
the dog-cart; from this expedition my aunt
returned somewhat shaken, and without having left
any of the cards which she had set out to distribute
on “old Mrs. Caploss, and those new people over
at Amblehurst Priory.” So far as I remember,
though, the unblenching Dixon soon managed to
reassure her, and the ‘funny tempered horse’ was
astutely exchanged for something with better manners.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He looked a regular timber-topper, all the
same,” remarked Dixon, shaking his head with
affectionate regret for the departed transgressor.
He had a warm heart for any horse in the world,
and, like every good groom, would sit up all night
with a hunter rather than risk leaving a thorn in
one of its legs after a day’s hunting.</p>

<p class="pindent">So far as I know, Dixon never made any attempt
to get a better place. Probably he was
shrewd enough to realize that he was very well off
where he was. And I am certain that my aunt
would have been much upset if he had given notice.
The great thing about Dixon was that he knew
exactly where to draw the line. Beyond the line,
I have no doubt, lay his secret longing to have an
occasional day with the Dumborough Hounds on
one of his employer’s horses. Obviously there was
no hope that ‘the mistress’ could ever be manipulated
into a middle-aged enthusiasm for the hazards
of the chase. Failing that, his only possible
passport into the distant Dumborough Elysium
existed in the mistress’s nephew. He would make
a sportsman of him, at any rate!</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">My first appearance in the hunting-field was
preceded by more than three years of unobtrusive
preparation. Strictly speaking, I suppose that
my sporting career started even earlier than that.
Beginning then with the moment when Dixon inwardly
decided to increase my aunt’s establishment
by the acquisition of a confidential child’s pony, I
pass to his first recorded utterance on this, to me,
important subject.</p>

<p class="pindent">I must have been less than nine years old at the
time, but I distinctly remember how, one bright
spring morning when I was watching him assist
my aunt into the saddle at her front door, he bent
down to adjust a strap, and having done this to
his final satisfaction made the following remark:
“We’ll soon have to be looking out for a pony for
Master George, ’m.”</p>

<p class="pindent">His tone of voice was cheerful but conclusive.
My aunt, who had, as usual, got her reins in a
tangle, probably showed symptoms of demurring.
She was at all times liable to be fussy about everything
I did or wanted to do. As a child I was
nervous and unenterprising, but in this case her
opposition may have prejudiced me in favour of
the pony. Had she insisted on my learning to
ride I should most likely have felt scared and
resentful.</p>

<p class="pindent">As it was, I was full of tremulous elation when,
one afternoon a few weeks later, Dixon appeared
proudly parading a very small black pony with a
flowing mane and tail. My aunt, realizing that it
was about to become her property, admired the
pony very much and wondered whether it went
well in harness. But since it was already wearing
a saddle, I soon found myself on its back, my
aunt’s agitated objections were rapidly overruled,
and my equestrianism became an established fact.
Grasping the pommel of the saddle with both
hands, I was carried down the drive as far as the
gate; the pony’s movements were cautious and demure:
on the return journey Dixon asked me
whether I didn’t think him a little beauty, but I
was speechless with excitement and could only nod
my assent. Even my aunt began to feel quite
proud of me when I relinquished my apprehensive
hold on the saddle and, for the first time in my
life, gathered up the reins. Dixon greeted this
gesture with a glance of approval, at the same time
placing a supporting hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stick your knees in, sir,” he said, adding, “I
can see you’ll make a rider all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He had never called me ‘sir’ before, and my
heart warmed toward him as I straightened my
back and inwardly resolved to do him credit.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>lthough,</span> in my mind’s eye, that first
pony is clearly visible to me, I am not going to
delay my already slow progress toward fox-hunting
by describing him in detail. It will be sufficient
if I quote Dixon, who called him ‘a perfect picture
of a miniature hunter.’ His name was Rob Roy,
and I thought him the most wonderful pony in the
world. Nimble and lightly built, his courageous
character never caused him to behave with more
than an attractive friskiness. My devotion to him
was therefore well justified. But as I sit here
reconstructing my life from those remote beginnings,
which are so difficult to recover in their
authentic aliveness, I cannot help suspecting that I
was, by nature, only half a sportsman. Dixon did
his best for me as he patiently coaxed me toward
my first fence (the idea of ‘jumping’ made me
horribly nervous for fully twelve months after I
became a proud owner of horseflesh), but there
must have been moments when he had grave doubts
about my future as a horseman.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I began my rides on Rob Roy, Dixon
used to walk beside me. Our longest expedition
led to a place about three miles from home. Down
in the Weald were some large hop-farms, and the
hop-kilns were interesting objects. It was unusual
to find more than two hop-kilns on a farm;
but there was one which had twenty, and its company
of white cowls was clearly visible from our
house on the hill. As a special treat Dixon used
to take me down there. Sitting on Rob Roy at the
side of the road I would count them over and over
again, and Dixon would agree that it was a wonderful
sight. I felt that almost anything might
happen in a world which could show me twenty
hop-kilns neatly arranged in one field.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is no use pretending that I was anything else
than a dreaming and unpractical boy. Perhaps
my environment made me sensitive, but there was
an ‘unmanly’ element in my nature which betrayed
me into many blunders and secret humiliations.
Somehow I could never acquire the knack
of doing and saying the right thing: and my
troubles were multiplied by an easily excited and
emotional temperament. Was it this flaw in my
character which led me to console my sense of unhappiness
and failure by turning to that ideal companion
whose existence I have already disclosed?
The fantasies of childhood cannot be analysed or
explained in the rational afterthoughts of experienced
maturity. I am not attempting to explain
that invisible but unforgotten playmate of mine.
I can only say that he was a consolation which
grew to spontaneous existence in my thoughts, and
remained with me unfalteringly until gradually
merged in the human presences which superseded
him. When I say that he was superseded I mean
that he faded out of my inward life when I went
to school and came in crude contact with other
boys. Among them he was obliterated but not replaced.
In my memory I see him now as the only
friend to whom I could confess my failures without
a sense of shame. And what absurd little
failures they were!</p>

<p class="pindent">At this moment I can only recall a single instance,
which happened about eighteen months
after the arrival of Rob Roy. By that time I was
going for rides of six or seven miles with Dixon,
and the ‘leading-rein’ was a thing of the past.
I was also having jumping lessons, over a small
brush-fence which he had put up in the paddock.
One day, inflated with pride, I petitioned, rather
shyly, to be allowed to go for a ride by myself.
Without consulting my aunt Dixon gave his permission;
he seemed pleased, and entrusted me with
the supreme responsibility of saddling and bridling
the pony without his help. I managed to do this,
in my bungling way, and I have no doubt that I
felt extremely important when I tit-tupped down
to the village in that sleepy afternoon sunshine of
thirty years ago. Rob Roy probably shared my
feeling of independence as he shook his little black
head and whisked his long tail at the flies. I was
far too big a man to look back as we turned out
of my aunt’s white gate into the dusty high road;
but I can imagine now the keen sensitive face of
Dixon, and his reticent air of amusement as he
watched us go out into the world by ourselves.
My legs were then long enough to give me a pleasant
feeling of security and mastery over my mount.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Here we are, Rob,” I remarked aloud, “off
for a jolly good day with the Dumborough.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And, in spite of the fact that it was a hot August
afternoon, I allowed my imagination to carry me
on into fox-hunting adventures, during which I
distinguished myself supremely, and received the
brush from the Master after a tremendous gallop
over hill and vale. I must mention that my knowledge
of the chase was derived from two sources:
firstly, the things I had heard in my conversation
with Dixon; and secondly, a vague but diligent
perusal of the novels of Surtees, whose humorous
touches were almost entirely lost on me, since I
accepted every word he wrote as a literal and serious
transcription from life.</p>

<p class="pindent">Anyhow, I had returned home with the brush
and received the congratulations of Dixon when
my attention was attracted by an extra green patch
of clover-grass by the roadside: I was now about
a mile beyond the village and nearly double that
distance from home. It seemed to me that Rob
must be in need of refreshment. So I dismounted
and intimated to him that he ought to eat some
grass. This he began to do without a moment’s delay.
But there was mischief in Rob Roy that afternoon.
With one knee bent he grabbed and
munched at the grass with his diminutive muzzle as
though he hadn’t had a meal for a month. Nevertheless,
he must have been watching my movements
with one of his large and intelligent eyes. With
characteristic idiocy I left the reins dangling on his
neck and stepped back a little way to admire him.
The next moment he had kicked up his heels and
was cantering down the road in the direction of his
stable. It seemed to me the worst thing that could
possibly have happened. It would take me years
to live down the disgrace. Panic seized me as I
imagined the disasters which must have overtaken
Rob Roy on his way home—if he <span class="it">had</span> gone home,
which I scarcely dared to hope. Probably his knees
were broken and I should never be able to look
Dixon in the face again. In the meantime I must
hurry as fast as my dismounted legs could carry
me. If only I could catch sight of that wretched
Rob Roy eating some more grass by the roadside!
If only I hadn’t let him go! If only I could begin
my ride all over again! How careful I would be!</p>

<p class="pindent">Hot and flustered, I was running miserably
toward the village when I turned a corner and saw,
to my consternation, the narrow, stooping figure of
Mr. Star. His eyes were on the ground, so I had
time to slow down to a dignified walk. I advanced
to meet him with all the nonchalance that I could
muster at the moment. The silver-haired schoolmaster
greeted me with his usual courtesy, as
though he had forgotten that he had been attempting
to teach me arithmetic and geography all the
morning. But I was aware of the mild inquiry in
his glance. If only I’d been carrying my green
butterfly-net instead of the rather clumsy old hunting-crop
of which I was usually so proud! I have
never been a clever dissembler, so I have no doubt
that my whole demeanour expressed the concealment
of delinquency. Mr. Star removed his black,
wideawake hat, wiped his forehead with a red handkerchief,
and genially ejaculated, “Well, well;
what a gloriously fine afternoon we are having!”</p>

<p class="pindent">As I was unable to say anything at all in reply,
he continued, with gentle jocularity (running his
eyes over the brown corduroy riding-suit which I
was just beginning to grow out of), “And what
have you done with your pony? You look almost
as if you’d lost him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">At this appallingly intuitive comment I gazed
guiltily down at my gaiters and muttered
abruptly, “Oh, I’m going to take him out after tea;
I was just out for a walk.”</p>

<p class="pindent">My voice died unhappily away into the dusty
sunshine.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. After tea! For all I knew, darling
Rob Roy might be <span class="it">dead</span> by then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For two
pins I could have burst into tears at that moment,
but I managed to control my feelings: Mr. Star
tactfully informed me that he must be getting on
his way, and our constrained interview ended.
Half an hour afterwards I slunk into the stable-yard
with a sinking heart. Dixon’s black retriever
was dozing with his head out of his kennel under
the walnut tree. No one seemed to be about. I
could hear the usual intermittent snorts and stampings
from inside the stable. There were two stalls
and a loose-box. My pony occupied the stall in
the middle. My heart thumped as I peeped over
the door, the upper half of which was open. Rob
Roy was facing me; he was attached to the ‘pillar-reins,’
still saddled and bridled. I am certain that
his face wore a look of amusement. A sense of profound
relief stole over me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A moment later
the stable-boy came whistling out of the barn with
a bucket. On seeing me he grinned derisively and
I retreated toward the house in dignified silence.
As I passed the kitchen window Mrs. Sosburn, the
fat, red-faced cook, dropped the cucumber which
she was peeling and greeted me with a startled
squeal.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Lawks, Master Georgie, whatever ’ave you bin
up to? The mistress ’as been in an awful state
about you, and Dixon’s gone down to the village
to look for you. We thought you must ’ave broke
your neck when the pony came trotting back without
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And the well-meaning woman bustled officiously
out to make sure I hadn’t any bones broken, followed
by the gaping kitchen-maid; a moment later
the parlour-maid came helter-skelter out of the
pantry, and I was inundated by exasperating female
curiosity and concern.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Gracious goodness! To think of him going off
by himself like that, and no wonder he got thrown
off, and the wonder is he wasn’t killed, and the
pony too,” they chorused; whereupon my aunt’s
head popped out of an upper window and they
clucked like hens as they reassured her about my
undamaged return.</p>

<p class="pindent">Infuriated by all this feminine fussiness I pushed
past them and scurried up the back stairs to the
schoolroom, whither Aunt Evelyn immediately followed
me with additional exclamations and expostulations.
I was now not only humiliated but
sulky, and had I been a few years younger my
rudeness would have ended in my being smacked
and sent to bed. As it was I was merely informed
that unless I learnt to behave better I should never
grow up into a nice man, and was left alone with
my tragic thoughts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Next morning I paid my customary visit to the
stable with a few lumps of sugar in my pocket.
Dixon was polishing a stirrup-iron at the door of
the little harness-room; he stopped in the middle of
a jaunty snatch of song to give me his usual greeting.
All my embarrassment faded out of me. His
impassive face made not the slightest reference to
yesterday’s calamity and this tactful silence more
than ever assured me of his infinite superiority to
those chattering females in the kitchen.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ince</span> the continuity of these memoirs is to depend
solely on my experiences as a sportsman,
I need not waste many words on the winter, spring,
summer, and autumn that chronologically followed
the last episode which I narrated. Outwardly
monotonous, my life was made up of that series of
small inward happenings which belong to the development
of any intelligent little boy who spends
a fair amount of time with no companion but himself.
In this way I continued to fabricate for myself
an intensely local and limited world. How
faintly the vibrations of the outer world reached us
on that rural atmosphere it is not easy to imagine
in this later and louder age. When I was twelve
years old I hadn’t been to London half a dozen
times in my life, and the ten sleepy miles to the
county town, whither the village carrier’s van went
three times a week, were a road to romance. Ten
miles was a long way when I was a child. Over
the hills and far away, I used to think to myself,
as I stared across the orchards and meadows of the
weald, along which ran the proverbially slow railway
line to London.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were a few events which created in my
mind an impression out of proportion to the architecture
of my earthly ideas. Among them was
Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee (though I cannot
pretend to remember exactly how it struck me
at the time, except that I counted fifty bonfires
from the hill near our house). This was balanced
by Canterbury Cricket Week: (I went there by
train with Dixon and spent a long hot day watching
Prince Ranjitsinhji make about 175 not out.
My aunt’s black Persian cat was called Ranji,
which made the celebrated Indian cricketer quite a
comfortable idea for me to digest).</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost my favourite books were <span class="it">The Palace in
the Garden</span> and <span class="it">Four Winds Farm</span>, both by Mrs.
Molesworth. Naturally there were other more
impressive phenomena which cropped up in my
mental existence, such as Scott’s <span class="it">Ivanhoe</span> and
Longfellow’s poem <span class="it">Excelsior</span>, and Beethoven’s
piano sonatas. But all these things clothed themselves
in local associations. Sir Walter Scott had
no existence outside of my aunt’s voice as she read
him aloud in the evening, Longfellow was associated
with Mr. Star in the schoolroom, Beethoven
lived somewhere behind the faded silk on the back
of the upright piano, and I never imagined any of
them as in any other edition than those in which I
knew them by sight. The large photograph of
Watt’s picture, ‘Love and Death,’ which hung in
the drawing-room, gave me the same feeling as the
‘Moonlight’ sonata, (my aunt could only play the
first two movements).</p>

<p class="pindent">In this brightly visualized world of simplicities
and misapprehensions and mispronounced names
everything was accepted without question. I find
it difficult to believe that young people see the
world in that way nowadays, though it is probable
that a good many of them do. Looking back across
the years I listen to the summer afternoon cooing
of my aunt’s white pigeons, and the soft clatter of
their wings as they flutter upward from the lawn
at the approach of one of the well-nourished cats.
I remember, too, the smell of strawberry jam being
made; and Aunt Evelyn with a green bee-veil over
her head.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The large rambling garden, with
its Irish yews and sloping paths and wind-buffeted
rose arches, remains to haunt my sleep. The
quince tree which grew beside the little pond was
the only quince tree in the world. With a sense of
abiding strangeness I see myself looking down
from an upper window on a confusion of green
branches shaken by the summer breeze. In an endless
variety of dream-distorted versions the garden
persists as the background of my unconscious existence.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">I had always been given to understand that I had
a delicate constitution. This was one of the reasons
which my aunt urged against my being sent to
school when Mr. Pennett, the pink-faced solicitor
who had charge of our affairs, paid us one of his
periodic visits and the problem of my education
was referred to in my presence. The solicitor used
to come down from London for the day. In
acknowledgment of his masculinity my aunt always
conceded him the head of the table at lunch.
I can remember him carving a duck with evident
relish, and saying in somewhat unctuous tones,
“Have you reconsidered, my dear Miss Evelyn,
the well-worn subject of a school for our young
friend on my left?”</p>

<p class="pindent">And I can hear my aunt replying in a fluttering
voice that she had always been nervous about me
since I had pneumonia (though she knew quite well
that it was only slight inflammation of the lungs,
and more than two years ago at that). Fixing my
gaze on his fat pearl tie-pin, I wondered whether
I really should ever go to school, and what it would
feel like when I got there. Nothing was said about
Mr. Star, but Mr. Pennett usually had a private
conversation with him on the subject of my progress.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your guardian seems an extremely well-informed
gentleman,” Mr. Star would say to me
after one of these interviews. For Mr. Pennett
had been to Harrow, and when Mr. Star spoke of
him I was vaguely aware that he had made the
modest old man feel even more humble than usual.
My aunt was perfectly satisfied with Mr. Star, and
so was I. But the solicitor knew that I was growing
out of my tutor; and so, perhaps, did Mr. Star
himself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Indeed, I was getting to be quite
a big boy for my age. People in the village were
saying that I was ‘filling out a fair treat,’ and
‘shooting up no end.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">To one little incident I can give an exact date—not
always an easy thing to do when one is looking
back such a long way. It was in 1896, on the last
Wednesday in May, and I had just returned from
my afternoon ride. My aunt was out in the garden,
wearing her leather gauntlets to cut some lilac,
when I dashed excitedly across the lawn shouting,
“Isn’t it splendid, Auntie—the Prince of Wales
has won the Derby!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, how splendid—has he really?” she exclaimed,
dropping the branch of white lilac which
she had just snipped off the tree with her huge pair
of scissors.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” I continued, bursting with the important
news, “we stopped at the station on our way home,
and the station-master showed Dixon the telegram.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What was it called?” she queried.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Persimmon, of course; I should have thought
you’d have known that!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Really, Georgie dear, you shouldn’t speak so
rudely to your aunt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I was silent for a moment, feeling crestfallen.
Then I remarked, in a subdued voice: “Earwig
was third.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Earwig! What an odd name for a horse!”
And then, as I bent down to pick up a spray of
lilac, she added: “Good gracious, darling, how
you’ve grown out of your riding-breeks! I really
must get you another corduroy suit.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">But my increasing size had another and far more
important effect. I was growing out of Rob Roy.
My aunt showed her inevitable lack of initiative in
the matter: she said that a small pony was safer
for me. During the summer, however, Dixon persistently
drew her attention to the obvious fact that
my legs were getting nearer and nearer to the
ground, although he had the highest respect for
gallant little Rob Roy, who was beloved by all who
knew him. The end of it was that a ‘perfect home’
was found for him, and he trotted out of my life as
gaily as he had trotted into it. After his departure
I had a good cry by myself in the kitchen garden.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I shall never be so fond of anyone again as I
was of Rob Roy,” I thought, mopping my eyes
with a grubby handkerchief. Subsequent events
proved my prophecy incorrect. And anyhow it
was a fine day, early in September; a few minutes
afterwards I was clambering up into a plum tree.
The plums were particularly good that year.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">As might be expected, Dixon lost no time in discovering
an adequate substitute for my vanished
favourite. For several weeks he remained reticent
on the subject, except that once or twice he mentioned
mysteriously that he thought he had heard
of something. Conscientious inquiries among
coachmen, innkeepers, and the local vet. and the insertion
of an advertisement in the county paper,
culminated in the arrival of a fourteen-hand,
mouse-coloured Welsh cog called Sheila. The
sight of Sheila struck awe into my heart. She
looked as much too big for me as Rob Roy had
looked too small. I also divined that she was enormously
expensive.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you really think Master George’ll be able to
manage her, Dixon?” asked my aunt, regarding
Sheila with deprecatory approbation. Dixon reiterated
his belief that the mare was thoroughly
handy and as quiet as an old sheep; he added that
we’d never get such a bargain again for thirty
pounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Jump on her back, Master George, and see if
she doesn’t give you a good feel,” suggested that
inexorably encouraging voice which was to make a
sportsman of me. Whereupon he quickly circumvented
the obvious fact that this was no jumping
matter by giving me a leg-up into the saddle (a
nearly full-sized one). There was no doubt at all
that I was a long way from the ground. Rather
timidly I surveyed the stable-yard from my new
altitude. Then Dixon led the cob carefully
through the gate into the paddock and she broke
into a springy trot.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ovember,</span> with its darkening afternoons
and smell of burning weeds, found me gradually
becoming acclimatized to ‘the new mare,’ as I
importantly called her (using Dixonian phraseology).
The groom was able to give me all his attention,
since my aunt never rode in the winter.
We now went longer distances; sometimes he
would tell me that we were ‘on the edge of the
Dumborough country,’ and he would pull up and
point out to me, a few miles away, some looming
covert where they often went to draw.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Dumborough, as I afterwards discovered,
was a scrambling sort of country to hunt in—heavily
wooded and hilly. But as we turned away
from its evening-lighted landscape I would listen
eagerly to Dixon’s anecdotes of the sport he had
seen there. He spoke often of Mr. Macdoggart,
Lord Dumborough’s hard-riding agent, and how
one year he had seen him win the Hunt Steeplechase
by a short head from a famous ‘gentleman-rider’;
and how, another year, Mr. Macdoggart
had got concussion of the brain while riding in the
same race.</p>

<p class="pindent">Our afternoon expeditions usually took us in the
Dumborough direction, and I suspect that Dixon
always had a faint hope that we might ‘chip in with
the hounds,’ though he knew too well that the foxes
rarely ran our way. He also showed an increasing
antipathy to the high road, and was continually
taking short cuts across the country.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’ll do them good to have a pipe-opener,” he
would say, turning in at a gate and setting his
horse going up a long stretch of meadow, and my
confidence in Sheila increased as I scuttled after
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sometimes he would pretend to be ‘riding a
finish,’ and I would say, “Tom, show me how Mr.
Macdoggart won the Hunt Cup on Nobleman.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I had never seen a race in my life; nor had I ever
been to a meet of the hounds. But I assiduously
studied the novels of Surtees, of which my aunt
had a complete set. She dipped into them herself
now and again, and we often used to talk about
Mr. Jorrocks.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Christmas approached Dixon drew her attention
to my rapid improvement as a rider. Finally
he took the bull by the horns and intimated that it
would do me no harm to go and have a look at the
hounds. She seemed taken aback by this, but he
assured her that he would only take me as far as
the meet. When she suggested that he could drive
me there in the dog-cart Dixon’s face assumed such
an air of disapproval that she gave way at once,
and it became only a matter of waiting for the next
‘near meet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">“I think, ’m, you can rely on me to take proper
care of Master George,” he remarked rather stiffly;
the next moment he looked at me with a grin of
delight followed by a solemn wink with the eye
furthest away from my aunt.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few days later I found him studying the local
paper in the leather-smelling little harness-room.
“They’re meeting at Finchurst Green on Saturday,”
he announced with appropriate seriousness.
It was an important moment in my life. Finchurst
Green was not quite nine miles away.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a grey and chilly world that I went out
into when I started for my first day’s fox-hunting.
The winter-smelling air met me as though with a
hint that serious events were afoot. Silently I
stood in the stable-yard while Dixon led Sheila out
of her stall. His demeanour was businesslike and
reticent. The horses and their accoutrements were
polished up to perfection, and he himself, in his
dark-grey clothes and hard black hat, looked a
model of discretion and neatness. The only one
who lacked confidence was myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stuffing a packet of sandwiches into my pocket
and pulling on my uncomfortably new gloves, I
felt half-aware of certain shortcomings in my outward
appearance. Ought one really to go out
hunting in a brown corduroy suit with a corduroy
jockey-cap made to match the suit? Did other
boys wear that sort of thing? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I was conscious,
too, that Dixon was regarding me with an
unusually critical eye. Mute and flustered, I
mounted. Sheila seemed very fresh, and the saddle
felt cold and slippery. As we trotted briskly
through the village everything had an austerely unfamiliar
look about it, and my replies to Dixon
were clumsy and constrained.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yet the village was its ordinary village-self.
The geese were going single file across the green,
and Sibson, the lame shoeing-smith, was clinking
his hammer in the forge as usual. He peered out
at us as we passed, and I saluted him with a slightly
forlorn wave of the hand. He grinned and ducked
his head. Sheila had had her shoes looked to the
day before, so he knew all about where we were
going.</p>

<p class="pindent">As we jogged out of the village Dixon gazed
sagaciously at the sky and said with a grim smile,
“I’ll bet they run like blazes to-day, there’s just the
right nip in the air,” and he made the horses cock
their ears by imitating the sound of a hunting-horn—a
favourite little trick of his. Secretly I wondered
what I should do if they ‘ran like blazes.’ It
was all very well for <span class="it">him</span>—he’d been out hunting
dozens of times!</p>

<p class="pindent">As we neared the meet I became more and more
nervous. Not many of the hunting people came
from our side of the country, and we saw no other
horsemen to distract my attention until we rounded
a bend of the road, and there at last was Finchurst
Green, with the hounds clustering in a corner and
men in red coats and black coats moving to and fro
to keep their horses from getting chilled. But this
is not the last meet that I shall describe, so I will
not invent details which I cannot remember, since
I was too awed and excited and self-conscious to be
capable of observing anything clearly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once we had arrived, Dixon seemed to become a
different Dixon, so dignified and aloof that I
scarcely dared speak to him. Of course I knew
what it meant: I was now his ‘young gentleman,’
and he was only the groom who had brought me to
‘have a look at the hounds.’ But there was no one
at the meet who knew me, so I sat there, shy and
silent—aware of being a newcomer in a strange
world which I did not understand. Also I was
quite sure that I should make a fool of myself.
Other people have felt the same, but this fact
would have been no consolation to me at the time,
even if I could have realized it.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">My first period of suspense ended when with
much bobbing up and down of hats the cavalcade
moved off along the road. I looked round for
Dixon, but he allowed me to be carried on with the
procession; he kept close behind me, however. He
had been sensible enough to refrain from confusing
me with advice before we started, and I can see
now that his demeanour continued to be full of intuitive
tactfulness. But he was talking to another
groom, and I felt that I was being scrutinized and
discussed. I was riding alongside of a large, lolloping
lady in a blue habit; she did not speak to
me; she confined herself to a series of expostulatory
remarks to her horse which seemed too lively and
went bouncing along sideways with its ears back,
several times bumping into Sheila, whose behaviour
was sedately alert.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon we turned in at some lodge-gates, crossed
the corner of an undulating park, and then everyone
pulled up outside a belt of brown woodland.
The hounds had disappeared, but I could hear the
huntsman’s voice a little way off. He was making
noises which I identified as not altogether unlike
those I had read about in Surtees. After a time the
chattering crowd of riders moved slowly into the
wood which appeared to be a large one.</p>

<p class="pindent">My first reaction to the ‘field’ was one of mute
astonishment. I had taken it for granted that there
would be people ‘in pink,’ but these enormous confident
strangers overwhelmed my mind with the
visible authenticity of their brick-red coats. It all
felt quite different to reading Surtees by the schoolroom
fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">But I was too shy to stare about me, and every
moment I was expecting an outburst of mad excitement
in which I should find myself galloping
wildly out of the wood. When the outbreak of
activity came I had no time to think about it. For
no apparent reason the people around me (we were
moving slowly along a narrow path in the wood)
suddenly set off at a gallop and for several minutes
I was aware of nothing but the breathless flurry of
being carried along, plentifully spattered with mud
by the sportsman in front of me. Suddenly, without
any warning, he pulled up. Sheila automatically
followed suit, shooting me well up her neck.
The next moment everyone turned round and we
all went tearing back by the way we had come. I
found Dixon in front of me now, and he turned
his head with a grin of encouragement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon afterwards the hunt came to a standstill in
an open space in the middle of the wood: the excitement
seemed to be abating, and I felt that fox-hunting
wasn’t so difficult as I’d expected it to be.
A little way below I could hear a confused baying
of the hounds among the trees. Then, quite close
to where I had halted, a tall man in a blue velvet
cap and vermilion coat came riding out from
among the undergrowth with one arm up to shield
his face from the branches. His face was very red
and he seemed upset about something. Turning
in my direction he bawled out in an angry voice,
“What the bloody hell do you think you’re here
for?”</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment I sat petrified with terror and
amazement. He was riding straight at me, and I
had no time to wonder what I had done to incur his
displeasure. So I stared helplessly until I was
aware that he had passed me and was addressing
someone immediately behind my horse’s heels.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Looking round I saw a surly-featured elderly man
with side-whiskers: he was on foot and wore the
weathered garments of a gamekeeper.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What the hell do you mean by leaving the main-earth
unstopped?” the infuriated voice continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very sorry, m’lord,” the man mumbled, “but
I never heard you was coming till this morning,
and——”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t answer me back. I’ll get you sacked for
this when Major Gamble comes down from Scotland.
I tell you I’m sick of you and your god-damned
pheasants,” and before the man could say
any more the outraged nobleman was pushing his
way into the undergrowth again and was bawling
“Go on to Hoath Wood, Jack,” to the invisible
huntsman.</p>

<p class="pindent">I looked at Dixon, whose horse was nibbling
Sheila’s neck. “That’s the Master,” he said in a
low voice, adding, “his lordship’s a rough one with
his tongue when anyone gets the wrong side of
him.” Silently I decided that Lord Dumborough
was the most terrifying man I had ever encountered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon was explaining that our fox had gone to
ground and I heard another man near me saying:
“That blighter Gamble thinks of nothing but shooting.
The place is crawling with birds, and the
wonder is that we ever found a fox. Last time we
were here we drew the whole place blank, and old
D. cursed the keeper’s head off and accused him of
poisoning the foxes, so I suppose he did it to get a
bit of his own back!” Such was my introduction
to the mysteries of ‘earth-stopping.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">The comparatively mild activities of the morning
had occupied a couple of hours. We now trotted
away from Major Gamble’s preserves. It was
about three miles to Hoath Wood; on the way several
small spinneys were drawn blank, but Hoath
Wood was a sure find, so Dixon said, and a rare
place to get a gallop from. This caused a perceptible
evaporation of the courage which I had been
accumulating, and when there was a halt for the
hunt-servants to change on to their second horses I
made an attempt to dispel my qualms by pulling
out my packet of sandwiches.</p>

<p class="pindent">While I was munching away at these I noticed
for the first time another boy of about my own age.
Dixon was watching him approvingly. Evidently
this was a boy to be imitated, and my own unsophisticated
eyes already told me that. He was
near enough to us for me to be able to observe him
minutely. A little aloof from the large riders
round him, he sat easily, but very upright, on a
corky chestnut pony with a trimmed stump of a
tail and a neatly ‘hogged’ neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Reconstructing that far-off moment, my memory
fixes him in a characteristic attitude. Leaning
slightly forward from the waist, he straightens his
left leg and scrutinizes it with an air of critical
abstraction. He seems to be satisfied with his
smart buff breeches and natty brown gaiters.
Everything he has on is neat and compact. He
carries a small crop with a dark leather thong,
which he flicks at a tuft of dead grass in a masterly
manner. An air of self-possessed efficiency begins
with his black bowler hat, continues in his neatly
tied white stock, and gets its finishing touch in the
short, blunt, shining spurs on his black walking
boots. (I was greatly impressed by the fact that
he wore spurs.) All his movements were controlled
and modest, but there was a suggestion of
arrogance in the steady, unrecognizing stare which
he gave me when he became conscious that I was
looking at him so intently. Our eyes met, and his
calm scrutiny reminded me of my own deficiencies
in dress. I shifted uneasily in my saddle, and the
clumsy unpresentable old hunting-crop fell out of
my hand. Dismounting awkwardly to pick it up,
I wished that it, also, had a thong (though this
would make the double reins more difficult to manage),
and I hated my silly jockey-cap and the
badly fitting gaiters which pinched my legs and
always refused to remain in the correct position
(indicated by Dixon). When I had scrambled up
on to Sheila again—a feat which I could only just
accomplish without assistance—I felt what a poor
figure I must be cutting in Dixon’s eyes while he
compared me with that other boy, who had himself
turned away with a slight smile and was now
soberly following the dappled clustering pack and
its attendant red-coats as they disappeared over the
green rising ground on their way to Hoath Wood.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">By all the laws of aunthood we should by now
have been well on our way home. But Dixon was
making a real day of it. The afternoon hunt was
going to be a serious affair. There never appeared
to be any doubt about that. The field was reduced
to about forty riders, and the chattersome contingent
seemed to have gone home. We all went into
the covert and remained close together at one end.
Dixon got off and tightened my girths, which had
got very loose (as I ought to have noticed). A
resolute-looking lady in a tall hat drew her veil
down after taking a good pull at the flask which
she handed back to her groom. Hard-faced men
rammed their hats on to their heads and sat silently
in the saddle as though, for the first time in the day,
they really meant business. My heart was in my
mouth and it had good reason to be there. Lord
Dumborough was keeping an intent eye on the ride
which ran through the middle of the covert.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Cut along up to the top end, Charlie,” he remarked
without turning his head; and a gaunt,
ginger-haired man in a weather-stained scarlet coat
went off up the covert in a squelchy canter.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s Mr. Macdoggart,” said Dixon in a low
voice, and my solemnity increased as the legendary
figure vanished on its mysterious errand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile the huntsman was continuing his intermittent
yaups as he moved along the other side
of the wood. Suddenly his cheers of encouragement
changed to a series of excited shoutings.
“Hoick-holler, hoick-holler, hoick-holler!” he yelled
and then blew his horn loudly; this was followed by
an outbreak of vociferation from the hounds, and
soon they were in full cry across the covert. I sat
there petrified by my private feelings; Sheila
showed no symptoms of agitation; she merely
cocked her ears well forward and listened.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, for the first time, I heard a sound
which has thrilled generations of fox-hunters to
their marrow. From the far side of the wood came
the long shrill screech (for which it is impossible
to find an adequate word) which signifies that one
of the whips has viewed the fox quitting the covert.
“Gone Away” it meant. But before I had formulated
the haziest notion about it Lord Dumborough
was galloping up the ride and the rest of them
were pelting after him as though nothing could
stop them. As I happened to be standing well inside
the wood and Sheila took the affair into her
own control, I was swept along with them, and we
emerged on the other side among the leaders.</p>

<p class="pindent">I cannot claim that I felt either excitement or
resolution as we bundled down a long slope of
meadowland and dashed helter-skelter through an
open gate at the bottom. I knew nothing at all except
that I was out of breath and that the air was
rushing to meet me, but as I hung on to the reins I
was aware that Mr. Macdoggart was immediately
in front of me. My attitude was an acquiescent
one. I have always been inclined to accept life in
the form in which it has imposed itself upon me,
and on that particular occasion, no doubt, I just
felt that I was ‘in for it.’ It did not so much as
occur to me that in following Mr. Macdoggart I
was setting myself rather a high standard, and
when he disappeared over a hedge I took it for
granted that I must do the same. For a moment
Sheila hesitated in her stride. (Dixon told me
afterwards that I actually hit her as we approached
the fence, but I couldn’t remember having done
so.) Then she collected herself and jumped the
fence with a peculiar arching of her back. There
was a considerable drop on the other side. Sheila
made no mistake, but as she landed I left the saddle
and flew over her head. I had let go of the reins,
but she stood stock-still while I sat on the wet
ground. A few moments later Dixon popped over
a gap lower down the fence and came to my assistance,
and I saw the boy on the chestnut pony come
after him and gallop on in a resolute but unhurrying
way. I scrambled to my feet, feeling utterly
ashamed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Whatever made you go for it like that?” asked
Dixon, who was quite disconcerted.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I saw Mr. Macdoggart going over it, and I
didn’t like to stop,” I stammered. By now the
whole hunt had disappeared and there wasn’t a
sound to be heard.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I suppose we may as well go on.” He
laughed as he gave me a leg-up. “Fancy you following
Mr. Macdoggart over the biggest place in
the fence. Good thing Miss Sherston couldn’t see
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The idea of my aunt seemed to amuse him, and
he slapped his knee and chuckled as he led me
onward at a deliberate pace. Secretly mortified by
my failure I did my best to simulate cheerfulness.
But I couldn’t forget the other boy and how ridiculous
he must have thought me when he saw me
rolling about on the ground. I felt as if I must be
covered with mud. About half an hour later we
found the hunt again, but I can remember nothing
more except that it was beginning to get dark and
the huntsman, a middle-aged, mulberry faced man
named Jack Pitt, was blowing his horn as he sat in
the middle of his hounds. The other boy was
actually talking to him—a privilege I couldn’t
imagine myself promoted to. At that moment I
almost hated him for his cocksureness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then to my surprise, the Master himself actually
came up and asked me how far I was from
home. In my embarrassment I could only mutter
that I didn’t know, and Dixon interposed with
“About twelve miles, m’lord,” in his best manner.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I hear he’s quite a young thruster.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
great man glanced at me for a moment with
curiosity before he turned away. Not knowing
what he meant I went red in the face and thought
he was making fun of me.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Now that I have come to the end of my first day’s
hunting I am tempted to moralize about it. But I
have already described it at greater length than I
had intended, so I will only remind myself of the
tea I had at an inn on the way home. The inn
was kept by a friend of Dixon’s—an ex-butler who
‘had been with Lord Dumborough for years.’ I
well remember the snug fire-lit parlour where I ate
my two boiled eggs, and how the innkeeper and his
wife made a fuss over me. Dixon, of course, transferred
me to them in my full status of ‘one of the
quality,’ and then disappeared to give the horses
their gruel and get his own tea in the kitchen. I
set off on the ten dark miles home in a glow of
satisfied achievement, and we discussed every detail
of the day except my disaster. Dixon had made
inquiries about ‘the other young gentleman,’ and
had learnt that his name was Milden and that he
was staying at Dumborough Park for Christmas.
He described him as a proper little sportsman; but
I was reticent on the subject. Nor did I refer to
the question of our going out with the hounds
again. By the time we were home I was too tired
to care what anybody in the world thought
about me.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was nearly seven o’clock when we got home;
as Aunt Evelyn had begun to expect me quite
early in the afternoon, she was so intensely relieved
to see me safe and sound that she almost forgot to
make a fuss about my prolonged absence. Dixon,
with his persuasive manner next morning, soon
hoodwinked her into taking it all as a matter of
course. He made our day sound so safe and confidential.
Not a word was said about my having
tumbled off (and he had carefully brushed every
speck of mud off my back when we stopped at the
inn for tea).</p>

<p class="pindent">As for myself, I began to believe that I hadn’t
done so badly after all. I talked quite big about it
when I was alone with my aunt at lunch on Sunday,
and she was delighted to listen to everything
I could tell her about my exploits. Probably it was
the first time in my life that I was conscious of having
got the upper hand of my grown-up relative.
When she asked whether there were ‘any other
little boys out on their ponies’ I was nonplussed for
a moment; I couldn’t connect young Milden with
such a disrespectful way of speaking. Little boys
out on their ponies indeed! I had more than half
a mind to tell her how I’d followed the great Mr.
Macdoggart over that fence, but I managed to remind
myself that the less said about that incident
the better for my future as a fox-hunter.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” I replied, “there was a very nice boy on a
splendid little chestnut. He’s staying at Dumborough
Park.” When I told her his name she
remembered having met some of his people years
ago when she was staying in Northamptonshire.
They had a big place near Daventry, she said, and
were a well-known sporting family. I packed
these details away in my mind with avidity. Already
I was weaving Master Milden into my day-dreams,
and soon he had become my inseparable
companion in all my imagined adventures, although
I was hampered by the fact that I only
knew him by his surname. It was the first time
that I experienced a feeling of wistfulness for
someone I wanted to be with.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">As a rule I was inclined to be stand-offish about
children’s parties, though there weren’t many in our
part of the world. There was to be a dance at Mrs.
Shotney’s the next Friday, and I wasn’t looking
forward to it much until my aunt told me that she
had heard from Mrs. Cofferdam that Lady Dumborough
was going to be there with a large party of
jolly young people. “So perhaps you’ll see your
little hunting friend again,” she added.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s not little; he looks about two years older
than me,” I retorted huffily, and at once regretted
my stupidity. ‘My hunting friend!’ I had been
allowing her to assume that we had ‘made friends’
out hunting. And when we were at the party she
would be sure to find out that he didn’t know me.
But perhaps he wouldn’t be there after all.
Whereupon I realized that I should be bitterly
disappointed if he wasn’t.</p>

<p class="pindent">At seven o’clock on Friday we set off in the village
fly. While we jolted along in that musty
smelling vehicle with its incessantly rattling windows
I was anxious and excited. These feelings
were augmented by shyness and gawkiness by the
time I had entered the ballroom, which was full of
antlers and old armour. Standing by myself in a
corner I fidgetted with my gloves. Now and again
I glanced nervously round the room. Sleek-haired
little boys in Eton jackets were engaging themselves
for future dances with pert little girls in
short frocks. Shyness was being artificially dispelled
by solicitous ladies, one of whom now
swooped down on me and led me away to be introduced
to equally unenterprising partners. The
room was filling up, and I was soon jostling and
bumping round with a demure little girl in a pink
dress, while the local schoolmaster, a solemn man
with a walrus moustache, thrummed out ‘The Blue
Danube’ on an elderly upright piano, reinforced by
a squeaky violinist who could also play the cornet;
he often did it at village concerts, so my partner
informed me, biting her lip as someone trod on her
foot. Steering my clumsy course round the room, I
wondered whether Lady Dumborough had arrived
yet.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was Aunt Evelyn, talking to Mrs. Shotney.
She certainly didn’t look half bad when you
compared her with other people. And old Squire
Maundle, nodding and smiling by the door, as he
watched his little grand-daughter twirling round
and round with a yellow ribbon in her hair. And
General FitzAlan with his eyeglass—he looked a
jolly decent old chap.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He’d been in the
Indian Mutiny.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The music stopped and the
dancers disappeared in quest of claret-cup and
lemonade. “I wonder what sort of ices there are,”
speculated my partner. There was a note of intensity
in her voice which was new to me.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, <span class="it">do</span> come on, Denis, the music’s begun,”
cried a dark, attractive girl with a scarlet sash—tugging
at the arm of a boy who was occupied with
an ice. When he turned to follow her I recognized
the rider of the chestnut pony. From time to time
as the evening went on I watched him enjoying
himself with the conspicuous Dumborough Park
contingent, which was dominating the proceedings
with a mixture of rowdiness and hauteur. Those
outside their circle regarded them with envious and
admiring antagonism. By a miracle I found myself
sitting opposite Denis Milden at supper, which
was at one long table. He looked across at me
with a reserved air of recognition.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Weren’t you out last Saturday?” he asked. I
said yes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Rotten day, wasn’t it?” I said yes it was
rather.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s a nice cob you were on. Jumped a bit
too big for you at that fence outside Hoath Wood,
didn’t she?” He grinned good-humouredly. I
went red in the face, but managed to blurt out a
confused inquiry after the health of his chestnut
pony. But before he could reply the Dumborough
boy had shouted something at him and I was
obliged to pay attention again to the little girl
alongside of me.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you hunt much?” she inquired, evidently
impressed by what she had overheard. Rather
loftily I replied that I hunted whenever I got the
chance, inwardly excusing myself with the thought
that it wasn’t my own fault that I’d only had one
chance so far.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was now positively enjoying the party, but
shortly afterwards Aunt Evelyn came gliding
across the dark polished floor at the end of polka
and adroitly extricated me from the festivities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“Really, darling, don’t you think it’s almost
time we went home?”</p>

<p class="pindent">I wished she wouldn’t call me darling in public,
but I fetched my overcoat and followed obediently
down to the draughty entrance hall. Denis happened
to be sitting on the stairs with his partner.
He jumped up politely to allow my aunt to pass.
I shot a shy glance at his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coming to Heron’s Gate on Tuesday?” he
asked. Deeply gratified, I said I was afraid it
was too far for me.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You ought to try and get there. They say it’s
one of their best meets.” He sat down again with
a nod and a smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wasn’t that young Milden—the nice-mannered
boy you spoke to as we went out?” asked Aunt
Evelyn when our rattle-trap conveyance was
grinding briskly down the road to the lodge-gates.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” I replied; and the monosyllable meant
much.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ext</span> morning I was a rather inattentive
pupil, but Mr. Star rightly attributed this to
the previous night’s gaities and was lenient with
me, though my eyes often wandered through the
window when they ought to have been occupied
with sums, and I made a bad mess of my dictation.
Mr. Star was still great on dictation, though I
ought to have been beyond such elementary exercises
at the age of twelve. ‘Parsing’ was another
favourite performance of his.</p>

<p class="pindent">The word parse always struck me as sounding
slightly ridiculous: even now it makes me smile
when I look at it; but it conjures up for me a very
clear picture of that quiet schoolroom: myself in a
brown woollen jersey with my elbows on the table,
and my tutor in his shabby tail-coat, chalking up
on the blackboard for my exclusive benefit the first
proposition of Euclid. Above the bookcase (which
contained an odd assortment of primers, poetry,
and volumes of adventure) hung a map of the
world—a shiny one, which rolled up. But the map
of the world was too large for me that morning,
and I was longing to look at the local one and find
out how far it was to Heron’s Gate (and where it
was).</p>

<p class="pindent">As soon as Mr. Star had gone home to his little
house in the village I slyly abstracted the ordnance
map from the shelf where my aunt kept it (she was
rather fond of consulting the map), and carried it
back to the schoolroom with a sensation of gloating
uncertainty. Heron’s Gate was hard to find, but I
arrived at it in the end, marked in very small print
with <span class="it">Windmill</span> right up against it and a big green
patch called <span class="it">Park Wood</span> quite near. I wondered
what it would look like, and at once visualized a
large, dim bird sitting on a white gate.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had
never seen a heron, but it sounded nice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
when I began measuring the distance with a bit of
string both bird and gate were obliterated by the
melancholy number of miles which meandered
across the map. The string told its tale too plainly.
Heron’s Gate was a good twelve miles to go.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">The situation now seemed desperate, but Dixon
might be able to do something about it. Without
saying a word to Aunt Evelyn I waited until we
were well away on our afternoon ride, and then
asked, quite casually, “Have you ever been to
Heron’s Gate, Tom?” (I had been telling him
about the dance, but had not mentioned Denis
Milden.) Dixon gravely admitted that he knew
Heron’s Gate quite well. There was a short silence,
during which he pulled his horse back into a
walk. “Is it far from us?” I remarked innocently.
He pondered for a moment. “Let’s see—it’s some
way the other side of Hugget’s Hill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. About
twelve miles from us, I should think.” I fingered
Sheila’s mane and tried another tack. “How far
were we from home when we finished up the other
night?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About twelve miles.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Unable to restrain myself any longer, I blurted
out my eagerness to go to the meet next Tuesday.
I never suspected that Dixon had known this all
the time, though I might have guessed that he had
looked up the list of meets in the local paper. But
he was evidently pleased that my sporting instinct
was developing so rapidly, and he refrained from
asking why I specially wanted to go to Heron’s
Gate. It was enough for him that I wanted to go
out at all. We duped Aunt Evelyn by a system of
mutual falsification of distances (I couldn’t find
the map anywhere when she wanted to look it up),
and at half-past eight on the Tuesday morning, in
glittering sunshine, with a melting hoar-frost on
the hedgerows, we left home for Heron’s Gate.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Emboldened by the fact that I was going out
hunting with an inward purpose of my own, I clip-clopped
alongside of Dixon with my head well in
the air. The cold morning had made my fingers
numb, but my thoughts moved freely in a warmer
climate of their own. I was being magnetized to
a distant meet of the hounds, not so much through
my sporting instinct as by the appeal which Denis
Milden had made to my imagination. That he
would be there was the idea uppermost in my mind.
My fears lest I should again make a fool of myself
were, for the moment, as far below me as my
feet. Humdrum home life was behind me; in the
freshness of the morning I was setting out for an
undiscovered country.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">My reverie ended when Sheila slithered on a
frozen puddle and Dixon told me to pay attention
to what I was doing and not slouch about in the
saddle. Having brought me back to reality he inspected
his watch and said we were well up to time.
A mile or two before we got to the meet he stopped
at an inn, where he put our horses into the stable
for twenty minutes, ‘to give them a chance to stale.’
Then, seeing that I was looking rather pinched
with the cold, he took me indoors and ordered a
large glass of hot milk, which I should be jolly
glad of, he said, before the day was out. The inn-parlour
smelt of stale liquor, but I enjoyed my
glass of milk.</p>

<p class="pindent">The meet itself was an intensified rendering of
my initiatory one. I was awed by my consciousness
of having come twelve miles from home. And
the scene was made significant by the phrase ‘one
of their best meets.’ In the light of that phrase
everything appeared a little larger than life: voices
seemed louder, coats a more raucous red, and the
entire atmosphere more acute with imminent jeopardy
than at Finchurst Green. Hard-bitten
hunting-men rattled up in gigs, peeled off their
outer coverings, and came straddling along the
crowded lane to look for their nags. Having
found them, they spoke in low tones to the groom
and swung themselves importantly into the saddle
as though there were indeed some desperate business
on hand.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Heron’s Gate was a featureless wayside inn at
the foot of a green knoll. I had not yet caught a
glimpse of Denis when the procession moved away
toward Park Wood, but I looked upward and
identified the bulky black Windmill, which seemed
to greet me with a friendly wave of its sails, as
much as to say, “Here I am, you see—a lot bigger
than they marked me on the map!” The Windmill
consoled me; it seemed less inhuman, in its
own way, than the brusque and bristling riders
around me. When we turned off the road and got
on to a sodden tussocked field, they all began to be
in a hurry; their horses bucked and snorted and
shook their heads as they shot past me—the riders
calling out to one another with uncouth matutinal
jocularities.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was frightened, and I might have wondered
why I was there at all if I had been old enough to
analyze my emotions. As it was I felt less forlorn
and insecure when we pulled up outside Park
Wood and I caught sight of Denis on his chestnut
pony. For the time being, however, he was unapproachable.
With a gesture of characteristic independence
he had turned his back on the jostling
riders, who were going one by one into the wood
through a narrow hunting-gate. I envied the unhesitating
self-reliance with which he cantered
along the field, turned his pony to put it at the low
fence, and landed unobtrusively in the wood. It
was all accomplished with what I should to-day
describe as an unbroken rhythm. Thirty years
ago I simply thought “Why can’t I ride like that?”
as I tugged nervously at Sheila’s sensitive mouth
and only just avoided bumping my knee against
the gatepost as I went blundering into the covert.
Dixon conducted me along one of the by-paths
which branched from the main-ride down the
middle.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’ll have to keep our ears open or they’ll slip
away without us,” he remarked sagely. “It’s an
awkward old place to get a fox away from, though,
and we may be here most of the morning.” Secretly
I hoped we should be.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where we rode the winter sunshine was falling
warmly into the wood, though the long grass in
the shadows was still flaked with frost. A blackbird
went scolding away among the undergrowth,
and a jay was setting up a clatter in an ivied oak.
Some distance off Jack Pitt was shouting ‘Yoi-over’
and tooting his horn in a leisurely sort of
style. Then we turned a corner and came upon
Denis. He had pulled his pony across the path,
and his face wore a glum look which, as I afterwards
learnt to know, merely signified that, for
the moment, he had found nothing worth thinking
about. The heavy look lifted as I approached him
with a faltering smile, but he nodded at me with
blunt solemnity, as if what thoughts he had were
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Morning. So you managed to get here.”
That was all I got by way of greeting. Somewhat
discouraged, I could think of no conversational
continuance. But Dixon gave him the respectful
touch of the hat due to a ‘proper little sportsman’
and, more enterprising than I, supplemented
the salute with “Bit slow in finding this morning
sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Won’t be much smell to him when they do.
Sun’s too bright for that.” He had the voice of
a boy, but his manner was severely grown-up.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a brief silence, and then his whole
body seemed to stiffen as he stared fixedly at the
undergrowth. Something rustled the dead leaves;
not more than ten yards from where we stood, a
small russet animal stole out on to the path and
stopped for a photographic instant to take a look
at us. It was the first time I had ever seen a fox,
though I have seen a great many since—both alive
and dead. By the time he had slipped out of sight
again I had just begun to realize what it was that
had looked at me with such human alertness.
Why I should have behaved as I did I will not
attempt to explain, but when Denis stood up in his
stirrups and emitted a shrill “Huick-holler,” I felt
spontaneously alarmed for the future of the fox.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t do that; they’ll catch him!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The words were no sooner out of my mouth
than I knew I had made another fool of myself.
Denis gave me one blank look and galloped off to
meet the huntsman, who could already be heard
horn-blowing in our direction in a maximum outburst
of energy.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where’d ye see ’im cross, sir?” he exclaimed,
grinning at Denis with his great purple face, as
he came hustling along with a few of his hounds
at his horse’s heels.</p>

<p class="pindent">Denis indicated the exact spot; a moment later
the hounds had hit off the line, and for the next
ten or fifteen minutes I was so actively preoccupied
with my exertions in following Dixon up and
down Park Wood that my indiscretion was temporarily
obliterated. I was, in fact, so busy and
flurried that I knew nothing of what was happening
except that ‘our fox’ was still running about
inside the wood. When he did take to the open
he must have slipped away unnoticed, for after
we had emerged the hounds feathered dubiously
over a few fields and very soon I found myself at
a standstill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon was beside me, and he watched intently
the mysterious operations of Jack Pitt, who was
trotting across a ploughed field with the pack behind
him. Dixon explained that he was ‘making
a cast.’ “He must be a long way ahead of us;
they could scarcely speak to him after they took
the line out of covert,” he commented.</p>

<p class="pindent">All this was incomprehensible to me, but I was
warned by my previous blunder and confined myself
to a discreet nod. Dixon then advised me not
to wear my cap on the back of my head: I pulled
the wretched thing well down over my eyes and
made a supreme effort to look like a ‘hard man to
hounds’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I watched the riders who were chatting
to one another in sunlit groups; they seemed
to be regarding the proceedings of Jack Pitt with
leisurely indifference.</p>

<p class="pindent">Denis, as usual, had detached himself from his
immediate surroundings, and was keeping an alert
eye on the huntsman’s head as it bobbed up and
down along the far side of a fence. Dixon then
made his only reference to my recent misconception
of the relationship between foxes and hounds.
“Young Mr. Milden won’t think much of you if
you talk like that. He must have thought you a
regular booby!” Flushed and mortified, I promised
to be more careful in future. But I knew
only too well what a mollycoddle I had made of
myself in the estimation of the proper little sportsman
on whom I had hoped to model myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“<span class="it">Don’t do that; they’ll catch him!</span>” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was
too awful to dwell on. Lord Dumborough would
be certain to hear about it, and would think worse
of me than ever he did of a keeper who left the
earths unstopped.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And even now some very
sporting-looking people were glancing at me and
laughing to one another about something. What
else could they be laughing about except my mollycoddle
remark? Denis must have told them, of
course. My heart was full of misery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Soon
afterwards I said in a very small voice, “I think I
want to go home now, Tom.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. On the way
home I remembered that Denis didn’t even know
my name.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>en</span> minutes late, in the hot evening sunshine,
my train bustled contentedly along between
orchards and hop gardens, jolted past the
signal-box, puffed importantly under the bridge,
and slowed up at Baldock Wood. The station was
exactly the same as usual and I was very pleased
to see it again. I was back from Ballboro’ for the
summer holidays. As I was going forward to the
guard’s van to identify my trunk and my wooden
play-box, the station-master (who, in those days,
wore a top-hat and a baggy black frock-coat)
saluted me respectfully. Aunt Evelyn always sent
him a turkey at Christmas.</p>

<p class="pindent">Having claimed my luggage I crossed the
bridge, surrendered my ticket to a red-nosed and
bearded collector, who greeted me good-naturedly,
and emerged from the station with my cricket-bat
(which was wrapped in my cricket-pads) under
my arm. Dixon was waiting outside with a smart
pony and trap. Grinning at me with restrained
delight, he instructed my luggage-trundling porter
to put it on the village omnibus and I gave the
man the last sixpence of my journey-money. As
we rattled up the road the unpunctual train with
a series of snorts and a streamer of smoke sauntered
sedately away into the calm agricultural
valley of its vocation.</p>

<p class="pindent">How jolly to be home for the holidays, I thought
to myself. So far neither of us had said a word;
but as soon as we were out of the village street (it
wasn’t our own village) he gave the pony a playful
flick of the whip and made the following remark:
“I’ve got a place for you in to-morrow’s
team.” Subdued triumph was in his voice and his
face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What, for the Flower Show Match!” I exclaimed,
scarcely able to believe my ears. He
nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the Flower Show Match was the match of
the year, and to play in it for the first time in my
life was an outstanding event: words were inadequate.
We mutually decided not to gush about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, you’re playing too?” I inquired. He
nodded again. Dixon was one of the mainstays of
the village team—a dashing left-hand bat and a
steady right-arm bowler. I drew a deep breath of
our local air. I was indeed home for the holidays!
Expert discussion of to-morrow’s prospects occupied
the remaining mile and a half to the house.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Miss Sherston won’t half be pleased to see
you,” he said as we turned briskly in at the white
gate. “She misses you no end, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn had heard us coming up the drive,
and she hurried across the lawn in her white
dress. Her exuberant welcome ended with—“But
you’re looking rather thin in the face, dear.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Don’t <span class="it">you</span> think Master George is looking rather
thin, Dixon? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We must feed him up well before
he goes back.” Dixon smiled and led the pony
and cart round to the stable-yard.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And now, dear, whatever do you think has
happened? I’ve been asked to help judge the vegetables
at the Flower Show to-morrow. Really, I
feel quite nervous! I’ve never judged anything
except the sweet peas before. Of course, I’m doing
them as well.” With great restraint I said
that I was sure the vegetables would be very interesting
and difficult.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m playing in the match,” I added, with casual
intensity. Aunt Evelyn was overjoyed at the
news, and she pretended to be astonished. No
doubt she had known about it all the time. The
roast chicken at dinner tasted delicious and my bed
felt ever so much more comfortable than the one
at school.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">My window was wide open when I went to bed,
and I had left the curtains half-drawn. I woke
out of my deep and dreamless sleep to a gradual
recognition that I was at home and not in the
cubicled dormitory at Ballboro’. Drowsily grateful
for this, I lay and listened. A cock was crowing
from a neighbouring farm; his shrill challenge
was faintly echoed by another cock a long way off.</p>

<p class="pindent">I loved the early morning; it was luxurious to
lie there, half-awake, and half-aware that there was
a pleasantly eventful day in front of me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Presently I would get up and lean on the window-ledge
to see what was happening in the world outside.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There was a starling’s nest under the
window where the jasmine grew thickest, and all of
a sudden I heard one of the birds dart away with
a soft flurry of wings. Hearing it go, I imagined
how it would fly boldly across the garden: soon I
was up and staring at the tree-tops which loomed
motionless against a flushed and brightening sky.
Slipping into some clothes I opened my door very
quietly and tip-toed along the passage and down
the stairs. There was no sound except the first
chirping of the sparrows in the ivy. I felt as if
I had changed since the Easter holidays. The
drawing-room door creaked as I went softly in and
crept across the beeswaxed parquet floor. Last
night’s half-consumed candles and the cat’s half-empty
bowl of milk under the gate-legged table
seemed to belong neither here nor there, and my
own silent face looked queerly at me out of the
mirror. And there was the familiar photograph
of ‘Love and Death,’ by Watts, with its secret
meaning which I could never quite formulate in a
thought, though it often touched me with a vague
emotion of pathos. When I unlocked the door
into the garden the early morning air met me with
its cold purity; on the stone step were the bowls
of roses and delphiniums and sweet peas which
Aunt Evelyn had carried out there before she went
to bed; the scarlet disc of the sun had climbed an
inch above the hills. Thrushes and blackbirds
hopped and pecked busily on the dew-soaked lawn,
and a pigeon was cooing monotonously from the
belt of woodland which sloped from the garden toward
the Weald. Down there in the belt of rivermist
a goods train whistled as it puffed steadily
away from the station with a distinctly heard clanking
of buffers. How little I knew of the enormous
world beyond that valley and those low green hills.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">From over the fields and orchards Butley
Church struck five in mellow tones. Then the
clock indoors whizzed and confirmed it with a less
resonant tongue. The Flower Show Match was
hours away yet—more than six hours in fact. Suppose
I’d better go back to bed again, I thought, or
I’ll be feeling tired out before the match begins.
Soon the maids would be stirring overhead, padding
about the floor and talking in muffled voices.
Meanwhile I stole down to the pantry to cut myself
a piece of cake. What a stuffy, smelling
place it was, with the taps dripping into the sink
and a bluebottle fly buzzing sleepily on the ceiling.
I inspected the village grocer’s calendar
which was hanging from a nail. On it there was
a picture of ‘The Relief of Ladysmith’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Old
Kruger and the Boers. I never could make up my
mind what it was all about, that Boer War, and it
seemed such a long way off.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yawning and
munching I went creaking up to my room. It was
broad daylight out of doors, but I was soon asleep
again.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter</span> breakfast there was no time to be
wasted. First of all I had to rummage about
for the tin of ‘Blanco,’ which was nowhere to be
found. Probably the parlour-maid had bagged it;
why on earth couldn’t they leave things alone? I
knew exactly where I’d left the tin at the end of
last holidays—on the shelf in the schoolroom, standing
on an old case of beetles (of which, for a
short time, I had been a collector). And now, unless
I could find the tin quickly, there’d never be
time for me to Blanco my pads, for they took
ever so long to dry in the sun, even on a blazing
hot day like this one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Really, it’s a bit thick, Aunt Evelyn; someone’s
taken my tin of ‘Blanco,’ ” I grumbled. But
she was already rather fussed, and was at that moment
preoccupied in a serious discussion with
Mabb, the gardener, about the transportation of
the crockery which she was lending for the Cricket
Tea.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a hasty parenthesis she confessed that she
had given the tin to Dixon only a week or two
ago, so I transferred myself and my grimy pads
to the harness-room, where I discovered Dixon
putting the finishing touches to his white cricket-boots;
he had already cleaned mine, and he apologized
for not having done my pads, as he had been
unable to find them. While I busied myself with
dabbing and smearing the pads we had a nice chat
about county cricket; he also told me how he had
taken a ‘highly commended’ at the Crystal Palace
Dog Show with one of the smooth-haired collies
which he had recently begun breeding. There had
been a lull in his horse-buying activities after I
went to school; since then I had given up my riding,
as my aunt could not afford to keep a cob
specially for me to ride in the holidays. So Dixon
had consoled himself with his collies and village
cricket: and the saddles were only used when he
was exercising the sedate horse which now shared
the carriage work with the smart little pony
‘Rocket.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leaving my pads to dry in the sun, I sauntered
contentedly back to the house to have a squint at
the morning paper, which never arrived until after
breakfast. I had a private reason for wanting to
look at the <span class="it">Morning Post</span>. I was a firm believer
in predestination, and I used to improvise superstitions
of my own in connection with the cricket
matches I played in. Aunt Evelyn was rustling
the newspaper in the drawing-room, where she
was having a short spell of inactivity before setting
forth to judge the vegetables and sweet peas.
Evidently she was reading about politics (she was
a staunch Tory).</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can’t understand what that miserable Campbell-Bannerman
is up to; but thank heaven the
Radicals will never get in again,” she exclaimed,
handing me the sheet with the cricket news on it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Carrying this into the garden I set about consulting
the omens for my success in the match. I
searched assiduously through the first-class scores,
picking out the amateurs whose names, like my
own, began with S, and whose initial was G.
There were only two that day: the result was most
unsatisfactory. <span class="it">G. Shaw run out</span>, 1: <span class="it">G. Smith</span>,
<span class="it">c. Lilley</span>, <span class="it">b. Field</span>, 0. According to that I should
only score half a run. So I called in professional
assistance, and was rewarded with <span class="it">Shrewsbury, not
out</span>, 127. This left me in a very awkward position.
The average now worked out at 64. The highest
score I had ever made was 51, and that was only
in a practice game at Ballboro’. Besides, 51 from
64 left 13, an unlucky number. It was absurd
even to dally with the idea of my making sixty-four
in the Butley Flower Show Match. Anything
between twenty and thirty would have been encouraging.
But Aunt Evelyn’s voice from the
drawing-room window informed me that she would
be starting in less than ten minutes, so I ran upstairs
to change into my flannels. And anyhow,
the weather couldn’t have been better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. While
we were walking across the fields Aunt Evelyn
paused on the top of a stile to remark that she felt
sure Mr. Balfour would be a splendid Prime Minister.
But I was meditating about Shrewsbury’s
innings. How I wished I could bat like him, if
only for one day!</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The village of Butley contained, as one of its
chief characters, a portly and prosperous saddler
named William Dodd. It was Dodd who now
greeted us at the field-gate and ushered Aunt
Evelyn into the large, tropical-temperatured tent
where the judges had already begun their expert
scrutiny of the competing vegetables.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the minds of most of the inhabitants of Butley
William Dodd was an immemorial institution,
and no village affairs could properly be transacted
without his sanction and assistance. As a churchwarden
on Sundays his impressive demeanour led
us to suppose that, if he was not yet on hat-raising
terms with the Almighty, he at any moment expected
to be. During a Parliamentary Election he
was equally indispensable, as he supervised the
balloting in the village schoolroom; and the sanguine
solemnity with which he welcomed the
Conservative candidate left no doubt at all as to his
own political opinions. He was a man much respected
by the local gentry, and was on free and
easy terms with the farmers of the neighbourhood.
In fact, he was a sort of unofficial mayor of the
village, and would have worn his robes, had they
existed, with dignity and decorum. Though nearer
fifty than forty, he was still one of the most vigorous
run-getters in the Butley eleven, and his
crafty underarm bowling worked havoc with the
tail-end of many an opposing team. On Flower
Show day he was in all his glory as captain of the
cricket team and secretary and treasurer of the
Horticultural Society, and his manner of receiving
my aunt and myself was an epitome of his urbane
and appreciative attitude toward the universe with
which the parish of Butley was discreetly associated.
Waggish persons in the village had given
him the nickname ‘Did-I-say-Myself.’ Anyone
who wanted to discover the origin of this witticism
could do so by stopping outside the saddler’s shop
on a summer morning for a few minutes of gentle
gossip. Laying aside whatever implement of his
craft he happened to be using, he would get up and
come to the door in his protuberant apron, and
when interrogated about ‘the team for to-morrow,’
“Let me see,” he would reply in a gravely complacent
voice, “Let me see, there’s Mr. Richard
Puttridge; and Myself; my brother Alfred; Tom
Dixon; Mr. Jack Barchard; young Bob Ellis—and
did I say Myself?”—and so on, counting the
names on his stubby fingers, and sometimes inserting
“and I think I said Myself” again toward the
end of the recital. But his sense of his own importance
was justified when he had a bat in his
hand. No one could gainsay that.</p>

<p class="pindent">Having, so to speak, received the freedom of the
Flower Show from this worthy man, there was
nothing more for me to do until the rest of the
players had arrived. At present there wasn’t a
cricketer to be seen on the small but well-kept
ground, and it seemed unlikely that the match
would start before noon. It was now a little after
eleven and a cloudless day. Sitting in the shadow
of a chestnut tree I watched the exertions of a
muscular man with a mallet. He was putting up
a ‘coconut shy’ in the adjoining meadow, where
a steam roundabout, some boat-swings, a shooting
gallery, and other recreative facilities were in
readiness for the afternoon. On the opposite side
of the cricket-field had been erected a Tea Tent,
which would contain such spectators as were
prevented, by their social status, from shying at
coconuts or turning almost upside-down in a boat-swing.
The ground sloped from the Tea Tent to
the side where I was sitting (twenty-five summers
ago), so that the genteel onlookers were enabled
to feel themselves perceptibly above the rest of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind the Tent was a thick thorn hedge; beyond
the hedge ran the dusty high road to the
village. In the late afternoon of a cricket match
there would be several dilatory vehicles drawn up
on the other side of the hedge, and the drivers
would watch the game in Olympian detachment.
There would be the carrier’s van, and the brewer’s
dray, and the baker’s cart, and the doctor’s gig,
and sometimes even a wagon-load of hay. None
of them ever seemed to be pressed for time, and
once they were there they were likely to stay till
the end of the innings. Rooks would be cawing
in the vicarage elms, and Butley, with its huddle
of red roofs and square church tower, was a contented-looking
place.</p>

<p class="pindent">In my retrospect the players are now beginning
to appear in ones and twos. Some skim easily
across the greensward on bicycles; others arrive
philosophically on foot, pausing to inspect the
wicket, which has a nasty habit of causing fast
bowling to ‘bump’ after a spell of dry weather.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon and I were having a little practice up
against the fence when Aunt Evelyn emerged
from the Flower Show Tent with a bevy of head-gardeners.
She signalled to me, so I clambered
over the palings and went up to her. She only
wanted to tell me that she would be back again
after lunch and did so hope she wouldn’t miss my
innings.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m feeling quite proud that Master George is
playing in the match,” she exclaimed, turning to
a short, clean-shaven, small-eyed man in a square
bowler hat and his dark Sunday suit, who was
standing near her. And then, to me, she added,
“I was just congratulating Mr. Bathwick on his
wonderful vegetables. We’ve given him the first
prize, and he thoroughly deserves it. You never
<span class="it">saw</span> such tomatoes and cucumbers! I’ve been telling
Mr. Bathwick that he’s a positive <span class="it">example</span> to
us all!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sam Bathwick, who had a very large mouth,
grinned bashfully, though his heavy, sallow face
had an irrepressibly artful look about it. He
farmed a little bit of land in an out-of-the-way corner
of the parish, and was reputed to have put by
more money than he admitted to.</p>

<p class="pindent">Climbing over the fence again I became aware
of the arrival of the Rotherden eleven in a two-horse
brake. It was close on twelve o’clock, but
they’d had a fourteen-mile drive and the road was
up and down hill all the way. How enormous they
looked as they sauntered across the ground—several
of them carrying cricket-bags. I should be
lucky if I made any runs at all against such men
as they were!</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Butley Church clock was tolling twelve while
our opponents were bearing down on us from the
other side of the field, with William Dodd already
half-way across to meet them. But the Rotherden
men appeared to be in no great hurry to begin the
game as they stopped to have a look at the wicket.
Meanwhile Butley bells chimed sedately to the
close of the mellow extra celebration which Providence
allowed them every three hours without
fail.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I suppose they’ve got their best team?” I faltered
to Dixon, whose keen gaze was identifying
the still-distant stalwarts.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You bet they have!” he replied with a grim
smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">Two of the tallest men had detached themselves
from the others and were now pacing importantly
down the pitch with Dodd between them.
Dixon indicated this group. “They’ve got Crump
and Bishop, anyhow,” he remarked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Crump
and Bishop! The names had a profound significance
for me. For many years I had heard Dixon
speak of them, and I had even watched them playing
in a few Flower Show Matches. Heavily
built men in dark blue caps, with large drooping
moustaches, one of them bowling vindictively at
each end and Butley wickets falling fast; or else
one of them batting at each end and Butley bowling
being scored off with masterful severity.</p>

<p class="pindent">But they had also produced a less localized effect
on me. Rotherden was on the ‘unlimited’
side of our district; it was in a part of the county
which I somehow associated with cherry-blossom
and black-and-white timbered cottages. Also it
had the charm of remoteness, and whenever I
thought of Crump and Bishop, I comprehensively
visualized the whole fourteen miles of more or less
unfamiliar landscape which lay between Butley and
Rotherden. For me the names meant certain
lovely glimpses of the Weald, and the smell of
mown hayfields, and the noise of a shallow river
flowing under a bridge. Yet Crump was an ordinary
auctioneer who sold sheep and cattle on market
days, and Bishop kept the ‘Rose and Crown’
at Rotherden.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>utley</span> had lost the toss. As we went on to
the field I tightened the black and yellow
scarf which I wore round my waist; the scarf
proved that I had won a place in my House Eleven
at school, and it was my sole credential as a cricketer.
But to-day was more exciting and important
than any ‘House Match,’ and my sense of my
own inferiority did not prevent me from observing
every detail of the proceedings which I am now
able to visualize so clearly across the intervening
years.</p>

<p class="pindent">The umpires in their long white coats have
placed the bails on the stumps, each at his own end,
and they are still satisfying themselves that the
stumps are in the requisite state of exact uprightness.
Tom Seamark, the Rotherden umpire, is a
red-faced sporting publican who bulks as large as
a lighthouse. As an umpire he has certain emphatic
mannerisms. When appealed to he expresses
a negative decision with a severe and
stentorian ‘<span class="sc">Not Out</span>’: but when adjudicating
that the batsman is out, he silently shoots his right
arm toward the sky—an impressive and irrevocable
gesture which effectively quells all adverse criticism.
He is, of course, a tremendous judge of the
game, and when not absorbed by his grave responsibilities
he is one of the most jovial men you could
meet with.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Sutler, our umpire, is totally different. To
begin with, he has a wooden leg. Nobody knows
how he lost his leg; he does not deny the local tradition
that he was once a soldier, but even in his
cups he has never been heard to claim that he gave
the limb for Queen and Country. It is, however,
quite certain that he is now a cobbler (with a
heavily waxed moustache) and Butley has ceased
to deny that he is a grossly partisan umpire. In
direct contrast to Tom Seamark he invariably
signifies ‘not out’ by a sour shake of the head:
when the answer is an affirmative one he bawls
‘Hout’ as if he’d been stung by a wasp. It is
reputed that (after giving the enemy’s last man
out leg-before in a closely fought finish) he was
once heard to add, in an exultant undertone—“and
I’ve won my five bob.” He has also been
accused of making holes in the pitch with his
wooden leg in order to facilitate the efforts of the
Butley bowlers.</p>

<p class="pindent">The umpires are in their places. But it is in the
sunshine of my own clarified retrospection that
they are wearing their white coats. While I was
describing them I had forgotten that they have
both of them been dead for many years. Nevertheless,
their voices are distinctly audible to me.
“Same boundaries as usual, Bill?” shouts Seamark,
as loudly as if he were talking to a deaf
customer in his tap-room. “Same <span class="it">as</span> usual, Muster
Seamark; three all round and four over the fence.
Draw at six-thirty, and seven if there’s anything
in it,” says Sutler. And so, with an intensified detachment,
I look around me at the Butley players,
who are now safely distributed in the positions
which an omniscient Dodd has decreed for them.</p>

<p class="pindent">I see myself, an awkward overgrown boy, fielding
anxiously at mid-on. And there’s Ned Noakes,
the whiskered and one-eyed wicketkeeper, alert and
active, though he’s forty-five if he’s a day. With
his one eye (and a glass one) he sees more than
most of us do, and his enthusiasm for the game is
apparent in every attitude. Alongside of him
lounges big Will Picksett, a taciturn good-natured
young yokel; though over-deliberate in his movements,
Will is a tower of strength in the team, and
he sweeps half-volleys to the boundary with his
enormous brown arms as though he were scything
a hayfield. But there is no more time to describe
the fielders, for Dodd has thrown a bright red ball
to Frank Peckham, who is to begin the bowling
from the top end. While Crump and Bishop are
still on their way to the wickets I cannot help
wondering whether, to modern eyes, the Butley
team would not seem just a little unorthodox.
William Dodd, for example, comfortably dressed
in a pale pink shirt and grey trousers; and Peter
Baitup, the ground-man (whose face is framed in
a ‘Newgate fringe,’) wearing dingy white trousers
with thin green stripes, and carrying his cap in his
belt while he bowls his tempting left-hand slows.
But things were different in those days.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime Bill Crump has taken his guard
and is waiting with watchful ease to subjugate the
first ball of the match, while Peckham, a stalwart
fierce-browed farmer, takes a final look round the
field. Peckham is a fast bowler with an eccentric
style. Like most fast bowlers, he starts about
fifteen paces from the wicket, but instead of <span class="it">running</span>
he <span class="it">walks</span> the whole way to the crease, very
much on his heels, and breaking his aggressive
stride with a couple of systematic hops when about
half-way to his destination. Now he is ready. Seamark
pronounces the word ‘Play!’ And off he
goes, walking for all he is worth, gripping the ball
ferociously, and eyeing the batsman as if he intends
to murder him if he can’t bowl him neck and crop.
On the ultimate stride his arm swings over, and a
short-pitched ball pops up and whizzes alarmingly
near Crump’s magnificent moustache. Ned
Noakes receives it rapturously with an adroit snap
of his gauntlets. Unperturbed, and with immense
deliberation, Crump strolls up the pitch and prods
with his bat the spot where he has made up his
mind that the ball hit the ground on its way toward
his head. The ground-man scratches his nose
apologetically. “Don’t drop ’em too short,
Frank,” says Dodd mildly, with an expostulatory
shake of his bristly grey cranium. Thus the
match proceeds until, twenty-five years ago, it is
lunch time, and Rotherden has made seventy runs
with three wickets down. And since both Crump
and Bishop have been got rid of, Butley thinks it
hasn’t done badly.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The Luncheon Tent stood on that part of the
field where the Flower Show ended and the swings
and roundabouts began. Although the meal was
an informal affair, there was shy solemnity in the
faces of most of the players as they filtered out of
the bright sunshine into the sultry, half-lit interior,
where the perspiring landlord of the ‘Chequers’
and his buxom wife were bustling about at the climax
of their preparations. While the cricketers
were shuffling themselves awkwardly into their
places, the brawny barman (who seemed to take
catering less seriously than his employers) sharpened
the carving-knife on a steel prong with a
rasping sound that set one’s teeth on edge while
predicting satisfactory slices of lamb and beef, to
say nothing of veal and ham pie and a nice bit of
gammon of bacon.</p>

<p class="pindent">As soon as all were seated Dodd created silence
by rapping the table; he then put on his churchwarden
face and looked toward Parson Yalden,
who was in readiness to take his cue. He enunciated
the grace in slightly unparsonic tones, which
implied that he was not only Rector of Rotherden,
but also a full member of the M.C.C. and first
cousin once removed to Lord Chatwynd. Parson
Yalden’s parishioners occasionally complained
that he paid more attention to cricket and pheasant
shooting than was fit and proper. But as long as
he could afford to keep a hard-working curate he
rightly considered it his own affair if he chose to
spend three days a week playing in club and country-house
matches all over the county. His
demeanour when keeping wicket for his own parish
was both jaunty and magisterial, and he was renowned
for the strident and obstreperous bellow to
which he gave vent when he was trying to bluff a
village umpire into giving a batsman out ‘caught
behind.’ He was also known for his habit of
genially engaging the batsman in conversation
while the bowler was intent on getting him out, and
I have heard of at least one occasion when he tried
this little trick on the wrong man. The pestered
batsman rounded on the rather foxy-faced clergyman
with, “I bin playing cricket nigh on thirty
years, and parson or no parson, I take the liberty
of telling you to hold your blasted gab.”</p>

<p class="pindent">But I hurriedly dismissed this almost unthinkable
anecdote when he turned his greenish eyes in
my direction and hoped, in hearty and ingratiating
tones, that I was “going to show them a little crisp
Ballboro’ batting.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The brisk clatter of knives and forks is now well
started, and the barman is busy at his barrel. Conversation,
however, is scanty, until Tom Seamark,
who is always glad of a chance to favour the company
with a sentiment, clears his throat impressively,
elevates his tankard, fixes Jack Barchard
with his gregarious regard, and remarks, “I should
like to say, sir, how very pleased and proud we all
are to see you safe ’ome again in our midst.” Jack
Barchard has recently returned from the Boer War
where he served with the Yeomanry. The ‘sentiment’
is echoed from all parts of the table, and
glasses are raised to him with a gruff “Good ’ealth,
sir,” or “Right glad to see you back, Mr. Barchard.”
The returned warrior receives their congratulations
with the utmost embarrassment.
Taking a shy sip at my ginger-beer, I think how
extraordinary it is to be sitting next to a man who
has really been ‘out in South Africa.’ Barchard
is a fair-haired young gentleman farmer. When
the parson suggests that “it must have been pretty
tough work out there,” he replies that he is thundering
glad to be back among his fruit trees again,
and this, apparently, is about all he has to say
about the Boer War.</p>

<p class="pindent">But when the meal was drawing to an end and
I had finished my helping of cold cherry-tart, and
the barman began to circulate with a wooden platter
for collecting the half-crowns, I became
agonizingly aware that I had come to the match
without any money. I was getting into a panic
while the plate came clinking along the table, but
quiet Jack Barchard unconsciously saved the situation
by putting down five shillings and saying, “All
right, old chap, I’ll stump up for both.” Mumbling,
“Oh, that’s jolly decent of you,” I wished
I could have followed him up a hill in a ‘forlorn
hope’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He told me, later on, that he never
set eyes on a Boer the whole time he was in Africa.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The clock struck three, and the Reverend
Yalden’s leg-stump had just been knocked out of
the ground by a vicious yorker from Frank Peckham.
“Hundred and seventeen. Five. Nought,”
shouted the Butley scorer, popping his head out of
the little flat-roofed shanty which was known as
‘the pavilion.’ The battered tin number-plates
were rattled on to their nails on the scoring-board
by a zealous young hobbledehoy who had undertaken
the job for the day.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Wodger</span> say last man made?” he bawled,
though the scorer was only a few feet away from
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Last man, <span class="it">Blob</span>.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The parson was unbuckling his pads on a bench
near by, and I was close enough to observe the unevangelical
expression on his face as he looked up
from under the brim of his panama hat with the
M.C.C. ribbon round it. Mr. Yalden was not a
popular character on the Butley ground, and the
hobbledehoy had made the most of a heaven-sent
opportunity.</p>

<p class="pindent">From an undersized platform in front of the
Horticultural Tent the Butley brass band now
struck up ‘The Soldiers of the Queen.’ It’s quite
like playing in a county match, I thought, as I
scanned the spectators, who were lining the fence
on two sides of the field. Several easily recognizable
figures from among the local gentry were
already sauntering toward the Tea Tent, after a
gossiping inspection of the Flower Show. I could
see slow-moving Major Carmine, the best dressed
man in Butley, with his white spats and a carnation
in his buttonhole; and the enthusiastic curate,
known as ‘Hard Luck’ on account of his habit
of exclaiming, “Oh, hard luck!” when watching
or taking part in games of cricket, lawn tennis,
or hockey. He was escorting the Miss Pattons,
two elderly sisters who always dressed alike. And
there was Aunt Evelyn, with her red sunshade up,
walking between rosy faced old Captain Huxtable
and his clucking, oddly dressed wife. It was quite
a brilliant scene which the Butley Band was doing
its utmost to sustain with experimental and unconvincing
tootles and drum-beatings.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon afterwards, however, the Soldiers of the
Queen were overwhelmed by the steam-organ
which, after a warning hoot, began to accompany
the revolving wooden horses of the gilded roundabout
with a strident and blaring fanfaronade.
For a minute or two the contest of cacophonies
continued. But in spite of a tempestuous effort
the band was completely outplayed by its automatic
and unexhaustible adversary. The discord
becoming intolerable, it seemed possible that the
batsmen would ‘appeal against the music’ in the
same way that they sometimes ‘appeal against the
light’ when they consider it inadequate. But William
Dodd was equal to the emergency; with an
ample gesture he conveyed himself across the
ground and prohibited the activity of the steam-organ
until the match was finished. The flitting
steeds now revolved and undulated noiselessly beneath
their gilded canopy, while the Butley Band
palavered peacefully onward into the unclouded
jollity of the afternoon.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The clock struck four. Rotherden were all out
for 183 and Tom Dixon had finished the innings
with a confident catch on the boundary off one of
Dodd’s artfully innocent lobs. No catches had
come my way, so my part in the game had been an
unobtrusive one. When Dodd and Picksett went
out to open our innings it was a matter of general
opinion in the Beer Tent that the home team had
a sporting chance to make the runs by seven
o’clock, although there were some misgivings about
the wicket and it was anticipated that Crump and
Bishop would make the ball fly about a bit when
they got to work.</p>

<p class="pindent">Having ascertained that I was last but one on
the list in the score-book, I made my way slowly
round the field to have a look at the Flower Show.
As I went along the boundary in front of the spectators
who were leaning their elbows on the fence
I felt quite an important public character. And
as I shouldn’t have to go in for a long while yet,
there was no need to feel nervous. The batsmen,
too, were shaping confidently, and there was a
shout of “Good ole Bill! That’s the way to keep
’em on the carpet!” when Dodd brought off one of
his celebrated square-cuts to the hedge off Bishop’s
easy-actioned fast bowling. Picksett followed this
up with an audacious pull which sent a straight
one from Crump skimming first bounce into the
Tea Tent, where it missed the short-sighted doctor’s
new straw hat by half an inch and caused quite
a flutter among the tea-sipping ladies.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Twenty up,” announced the scorer, and the
attendant hobbledehoy nearly fell over himself in
his eagerness to get the numbers up on the board.
A stupendous appeal for a catch at the wicket by
the Reverend Yalden was countered by Sutler with
his surliest shake of the head, and the peg-supported
umpire was the most popular man on the
field as he ferried himself to his square-leg location
at the end of the over. Forty went up; then
Dodd was clean bowled by Crump.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’Ow’s <span class="it">that</span>?” bawled a ribald Rotherden partisan
from a cart in the road, as the rotund batsman
retreated; warm but majestic, he acknowledged
the applause of the onlookers by a slight lifting of
his close-fitting little cap. Everybody was delighted
that he had done so well, and it was agreed
that he was (in the Beer Tent) “a regular chronic
old sport” and (in the Tea Tent) “a wonderful
man for his age.” Modest Jack Barchard then
made his appearance and received a Boer War
ovation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leaving the game in this prosperous condition, I
plunged into the odoriferous twilight of the Horticultural
Tent. I had no intention of staying
there long, but I felt that I owed it to Aunt Evelyn
to have a look at the sweet peas and vegetables at
any rate. In the warm muffled air the delicate
aroma of the elegant sweet peas was getting much
the worst of it in an encounter with the more aggressive
smell of highly polished onions. Except
for a couple of bearded gardeners who were conferring
in professional undertones, I had the tent
to myself. Once I was inside I felt glad to be
loitering in there, alone and away from the optical
delirium of the cricket. The brass band had
paused to take breath: now and again the brittle
thud of a batsman’s stroke seemed to intensify the
quiescence of the floralized interior.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I sniffed my way round I paid little attention
to the card-inscribed names of the competitors
(though I observed that the Miss Pattons had got
second prize for a tasteful table-decoration): I
found many of the flowers tedious and unpleasing—more
especially the bulbous and freckled varieties
with the unpronounceable names—the kind of flowers
which my aunt always referred to as ‘gardeners’
greenhouseries.’ On the whole the fruit and
vegetables gave me most enjoyment. The black
cherries looked delicious and some of the green
gooseberries were as large as small hen’s eggs. The
two gardeners were concentrating on Sam Bathwick’s
first prize vegetables and as they seemed to
grudge making way for me I contented myself
with a glimpse of an immense marrow and some
very pretty pink potatoes. As I passed, one of
the gardeners was saying something about “copped
’im a fair treat this time,” and I absent-mindedly
wondered who had been copped. When I emerged
the home team had lost two more wickets and the
condition of the game was causing grave anxiety.
Reluctantly I drifted toward the Tea Tent for a
period of social victimization.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The Tea Tent was overcrowded and I found
Aunt Evelyn sitting a little way outside it in comparative
seclusion. She was in earnest communication
with Miss Clara Maskall, a remarkable old
lady who had been born in the year of the Battle
of Waterloo and had been stone-deaf for more
than sixty years.</p>

<p class="pindent">My aunt was one of the few people in the neighbourhood
who enjoyed meeting Miss Maskall.
For the old lady had a way of forgetting that the
rest of the world could hear better than she could,
and her quavering comments on some of the local
gentlefolk, made in their presence, were often too
caustic to be easily forgotten. She was reputed
to have been kissed by King George the Fourth.
She was wearing a bunched-up black silk dress,
and her delicately withered face was framed in a
black poke-bonnet, tied under the chin with a
white lace scarf. With her piercingly alert eyes
and beaky nose she looked like some ancient and
intelligent bird. Altogether she was an old person
of great distinction, and I approached her with an
awful timidity. She had old-fashioned ideas about
education, and she usually inquired of me, in creaking
tones, whether I had recently been flogged by
my schoolmaster.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the menace of Roman Catholicism was her
most substantial and engrossing theme; and up to
the age of ninety she continued to paste on the
walls of her bedroom every article on the subject
which she could find in <span class="it">The Times</span> and the <span class="it">Morning
Post</span>. Aunt Evelyn told me that the walls
were almost entirely papered with printed matter,
and that she had more than once found Miss
Maskall sitting on the top step of a library ladder
reading some altitudinous article on this momentous
question of ‘the Scarlet Woman.’ To the day
of her death she never so much as trifled with a
pair of spectacles. But she was still very much
alive when I saw her at the Flower Show Match.
Sitting bolt upright in a wicker-chair, she scrutinized
me keenly and then favoured me with a
friendly little nod without losing touch with what
my aunt was engaged in telling her by ‘finger-talk.’</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">What</span> is it the man has been doing, Evelyn?”
she asked, her queer, uncontrolled voice quavering
up to a bird-like shrillness. There was something
rather frightening about her defective intonation.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Write it down; write it down,” she screeched,
clawing a tablet and pencil out of her lap and consigning
them to Aunt Evelyn, who hurriedly scribbled
two or three lines and returned the tablet for
her to read aloud, “such a dreadful thing, the
judges have found out that Bathwick has been
cheating with his prize vegetables.” She passed it
back with a tremulous cackle.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How did he do it?” More scribbling, and then
she read out, “He bought all the vegetables at
Ashbridge. The judges suspected him, so they
went to his garden in a pony trap and found that
he has <span class="it">no glass</span>—not even a cucumber frame.”
Miss Maskall chuckled delightedly at this, and
said that he ought to be given a special prize.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I call it downright dishonest. Almost as bad
as embezzlement,” wrote Aunt Evelyn who, as one
of the judges, could scarcely be expected to treat
the offence in a spirit of levity.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Clara now insisted that she must herself
inspect the fraudulent vegetables. Rising energetically
from her chair, she grasped her ebony
stick with an ivory knuckled hand, and shaped an
uncompromising course for the Horticultural Tent
with Aunt Evelyn and myself in tow. The villagers
at the gate made way for her with alacrity,
as though it had dawned on them that she was not
only the most ancient, but by far the most interesting
object to be seen at the Flower Show Match.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Maskall had made the game seem rather
remote. She cared nothing for cricket, and had
only come there for an afternoon spree. But she
was taciturn during her tour of the Flower Show:
when we tucked her into her shabby old victoria
she leant back and closed her eyes. Years ago she
must have had a lovely face. While we watched
her carriage turn the corner I wondered what it
felt like to be eighty-seven; but I did not connect
such antiquity with my own future. Long before
I was born she had seen gentlemen playing cricket
in queer whiskers and tall hats.</p>

<p class="pindent">Next moment I was safely back in the present,
and craning my neck for a glimpse of the score-board
as I hustled Aunt Evelyn along to the Tea
Tent. There had been a Tea Interval during our
absence, so we hadn’t missed so very much. Five
wickets were done for ninety and the shadows of
the cricketers were growing longer in the warm
glare which slanted down the field. A sense of
my own share in the game invaded me and it was
uncomfortable to imagine that I might soon be
walking out into the middle to be bowled at by
Crump and Bishop, who now seemed gigantic and
forbidding. And then impetuous Ned Noakes
must needs call Frank Peckham for an impossibly
short run, and his partner retreated with a wrathful
shake of his head. Everything now depended on
Dixon who was always as cool in a crisis.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Give ’em a bit of the long handle, Tom!”
bawled someone from the Beer Tent, while he
marched serenely toward the wicket, pausing for
a confidential word with Noakes who was still looking
a bit crestfallen after the recent catastrophe.
Dixon was a stylish left-hander and never worried
much about playing himself in. Bishop was well
aware of this, and he at once arranged an extra
man in the outfield for him. Sure enough, the
second ball he received was lifted straight into
long-off’s hands. But the sun was in the fielder’s
eyes and he misjudged the flight of the catch. The
Beer Tent exulted vociferously. Dixon then set
about the bowling and the score mounted merrily.
He was energetically supported by Ned Noakes.
But when their partnership had added over fifty,
and they looked like knocking off the runs, Noakes
was caught in the slips off a bumping ball and the
situation instantly became serious again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Realizing that I was in next but one, I went off
in a fluster to put my pads on, disregarding Aunt
Evelyn’s tremulous “I do so hope you’ll do well,
dear.” By the time I had arrived on the other side
of the ground, Amos Hickmott, the wheelwright’s
son, had already caused acute anxiety. After surviving
a tigerish appeal for ‘leg-before,’ he had as
near as a toucher run Dixon out in a half-witted
endeavour to escape from the bowling. My palsied
fingers were still busy with straps and buckles
when what sounded to me like a deafening crash
warned me that it was all over with Hickmott. We
still wanted seven runs to win when I wandered
weakly in the direction of the wicket. But it was
the end of an over, and Dixon had the bowling.
When I arrived the Reverend Yalden was dawdling
up the pitch in his usual duck-footed progress
when crossing from one wicket to the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, young man, you’ve got to look lively this
time,” he observed with intimidating jocosity.
But there seemed to be a twinkle of encouragement
in Seamark’s light blue eye as I established
myself in his shadow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon played the first three balls carefully. The
fourth he smote clean out of the ground. The hit
was worth six, but ‘three all round and four over’
was an immemorial rule at Butley. Unfortunately,
he tried to repeat the stroke, and the fifth
ball shattered his stumps. In those days there
were only five balls to an over.</p>

<p class="pindent">Peter Baitup now rolled up with a wide grin on
his fringed face, but it was no grinning moment
for me at the bottom end when Sutler gave me
‘middle-and-leg’ and I confronted impending
disaster from Crump with the sun in my eyes. The
first ball (which I lost sight of) missed my wicket
by ‘a coat of varnish’ and travelled swiftly to the
boundary for two byes, leaving Mr. Yalden with
his huge gauntlets above his head in an attitude of
aggrieved astonishment. The game was now a
tie. Through some obscure psychological process
my whole being now became clarified. I remembered
Shrewsbury’s century and became as bold as
brass. There was the enormous auctioneer with
the ball in his hand. And there I, calmly resolved
to look lively and defeat his destructive aim. The
ball hit my bat and trickled slowly up the pitch.
“Come on!” I shouted, and Peter came gallantly
on. Crump was so taken by surprise that we were
safe home before he’d picked up the ball. And
that was the end of the Flower Show Match.</p>

<div><h1 id="ch3"><span style="font-size:larger"><span class="it">Part Three</span></span><br> A FRESH START</h1></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">E</span>xcept</span> for the letters written to me by Mr.
Pennett I have no documentary evidence concerning
the young man who was existing under
my name in the summer after I left Cambridge.
The fact that I have preserved them is a proof that
I was aware of their significance, although it is
now nearly twenty years since I last read them
through. In these days they would be typewritten;
but in those days they were fair-copied by a
clerk, and the slanting calligraphy helps me to recapture
my faded self as I was when I apprehensively
extracted them from their envelopes. Even
now they make rather uncomfortable reading, and
I find myself wondering how their simple-minded
recipient managed to repel such an onslaught of
worldly wisdom.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Tom Dixon was still about the place to
pitchfork me into the village cricket team; and it
happened that it was on a showery June morning,
when I was setting out for one of the Butley
matches, that I received the first really uncomfortable
letter from Mr. Pennett. We were playing
over at Rotherden, which meant an early start,
as it was fourteen miles away. So I slipped the
letter into my pocket unopened and perused it at
intervals later on in the day. My Aunt Evelyn,
I may say, never made any attempt to influence
me in my choice of a career. Like me, she preferred
to procrastinate, and her intuition probably
warned her that my mind was unlikely to habituate
itself to the quibbling technicalities of the legal
profession. But whatever she thought she kept to
herself. She was still addicted to saying that I
was ‘none too strong,’ and this delicacy of constitution
which she ascribed to me was in itself a
more than adequate argument against my over-taxing
my health with tedious text-books in the
unwholesome air of a London office.</p>

<p class="pindent">“George is a boy who ought not to be interfered
with too much,” she would say. And I agreed
with her opinion unreservedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Pennett, however, had conscientiously dictated
to his clerk a couple of pages of expostulation
and advice with the unmistakable object of
interfering with me as much as possible. But the
letter remained in my pocket until after we had
arrived at Rotherden.</p>

<p class="pindent">The air was Elysian with early summer and the
shadows of steep white clouds were chasing over
the orchards and meadows; sunlight sparkled on
green hedgerows that had been drenched by early
morning showers. As I was carried past it all I
was lazily aware through my dreaming and unobservant
eyes that this was the sort of world I
wanted. For it was my own countryside, and I
loved it with an intimate feeling, though all its
associations were crude and incoherent. I cannot
think of it now without a sense of heartache, as if
it contained something which I have never quite
been able to discover.</p>

<p class="pindent">Thus we jogged and jingled along in the rumbling
two-horse brake with the Butley team talking
their parish talk, and every house and hamlet animating
William Dodd to some local-flavored
anecdote. Dodd was in a holiday humour, and
there wasn’t much that he didn’t know about the
living-memoried local history which lay between
Butley and Rotherden. The doings of the county
cricket team were also discussed; Dodd had
watched them at Dumbridge last week and had
spoken to Blythe, who was, in his opinion, the best
slow left-hand bowler in England. The road
went up and down hill, by orchards and hop gardens
and parks crowded with ancient oaks. Nearly
all the way we were looking, on our left-hand side,
across the hop-kiln-dotted Weald. And along the
Weald went the railway line from London to the
coast, and this gave me a soberly romantic sense
of distances and the outside world of unfamiliar
and momentous happenings. I knew very little
about London, and I had never been across the
Channel, but as I watched a train hurrying between
the level orchards with its consequential
streamer of smoke, I meditated on the coast-line
of France and all the unvisualized singularity of
that foreign land. And then Rotherden Church
hove in sight with its square battlemented tower,
and we turned into the stable-yard of the ‘Rose
and Crown,’ where Bert Bishop, the landlord, was
waiting to welcome us—a stouter man than he
used to be, but still as likely as not to hit up a
hundred.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Butley batted first. I was in eighth. Mr. Pennett’s
letter was in my pocket. Sitting on a gate
in a remote corner of the ground I opened the
envelope with a sinking heart. Mr. Pennett wrote
as follows:</p>

<p class="pindent">“My dear George, I have learned from your
College Tutor, much to my regret, that you have
gone down from Cambridge, at any rate for this
term. I think that you have made a mistake in so
doing and that this arises from perhaps a lack of
appreciation on your part of the value of an University
education. One of the objects of an University
career is to equip the student for the battle
of life, and as you grow older you will find that
people are estimated in the world by the results
which they have obtained at the Varsity. It is a
kind of stamp upon a man and is supposed to indicate
the stuff of which he is made. With a degree
you start with so much capital to the good, but if
on the other hand having once commenced an University
career you abandon it, the fact will militate
against you in almost everything you undertake
hereafter. Although you are nearly twenty-two
you cannot be expected yet to look at things in
precisely the same light as those who have had
more experience, but knowing as I do the great
importance of the whole matter I do most earnestly
beg you to reconsider the decision at which
you have arrived. G. Sherston, M.A., will rank
higher than plain G. Sherston, and the mere fact
of your being able to attach the magic letters to
your name will show that whatever may be your
capabilities you have at any rate grit and perseverance.
I hope, therefore, that you will see that
the step you have taken is one of unwisdom and
that before it is too late you will carefully reconsider
it. Forgive this homily, but I am sure that
whether it is to your taste or not you will at least
acknowledge that it proceeds from a strong desire
to be of use to you from—your sincere friend,
Percival G. Pennett.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It amuses me now when I think of the well-meaning
lawyer dictating that letter in his Lincoln
Inn office, and of myself with my gaze recoiling
from the wiseacre phraseology to follow a rook
which was travelling overhead with querulous cawings.
Everything the letter said was so true; and
yet, I wondered, was it really possible for P.G.P.
to tell me what was best for my future? His letter
made one effect which would have astonished him.
Worried and put out of temper by it, I slouched
to the wicket after lunch without caring a hoot
whether I stayed there or not. The result was
that, favoured by a fair amount of luck, I ‘carted’
the bowling all over the field; at the end of our
innings I was not out forty-three. This was the
highest score I had ever made for the village; and,
although we lost the match by five wickets, I finished
the day in a glow of self-satisfaction which
was undamped by a tremendous thunderstorm
which overtook us on our way home.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Pennett’s procedure for bringing me to my
senses about ‘an University degree’ was an excellent
example of preaching to the winds. Good
advice seldom sinks into the wayward mind of a
young man, and in this case the carefully composed
phrases meant nothing to me. The utmost I
could do was to transmute his prudent precepts
into some such sentiment as this: “The silly old
blighter is trying to make me stay up at Cambridge
when I’m absolutely fed up with the whole
concern.” Not that I made any serious attempt to
‘carefully reconsider’ my decision. I had not yet
begun to train myself to think rationally about
anything. No one was ever less capable of putting
two and two together than I was. And he made
a strategic mistake when he adjured me to ‘look
ahead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I very much doubt whether anybody wants to
look ahead unless he is anxious to escape from one
condition into another more desirable one. Children
hanker to be grown-up because they want
liberty. But why should a young man who has
inherited a net income of about six hundred a year
find it easy or necessary to imagine himself as ten
or twenty years older? If I ever thought of myself
as a man of thirty-five it was a visualization
of dreary decrepitude. The word maturity had
no meaning for me. I did not anticipate that I
should become <span class="it">different</span>; I should only become
<span class="it">older</span>. I cannot pretend that I aspired to growing
wiser. I merely <span class="it">lived</span>. And in that condition
I drifted from day to day. Ignorantly unqualified
to regulate the human mechanism which I was in
charge of, my self-protective instincts were continually
being contradicted by my spontaneously
capricious behaviour. When Mr. Pennett referred
me to what he called ‘after-life,’ he was
unaware that for me the future was a matter of the
four seasons of the year. There was next autumn,
and next winter, and after that next spring. But
this summer was the only thing that I cared about.
The phrase ‘after-life’ was also vaguely confused
with going to church and not wanting to be dead—a
perplexity which can be omitted from a narrative
in which I am doing my best to confine
myself to actual happenings. At the age of
twenty-two I believed myself to be unextinguishable.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was a wet and windy afternoon toward the
end of September. We were on our way
home from a seaside place in Devonshire, where
we had been staying for a change of air. Aunt
Evelyn was going through a period of bad health,
and her headaches were probably much worse than
she admitted. Anyhow, she had been content to
do very little, and I caused her no anxiety, for I
had ‘taken up golf’ and most of my time and
energy had evaporated on the links. The people
I played with at Bidmouth were equally engrossed
by the game, and if they had any ideas about
things other than golf they showed no inclination
to share them with me. Aunt Evelyn wasn’t sorry
to be going home again; there was plenty to be
done in the garden, and how the cats had got on
without her she couldn’t imagine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of my own sensations about our return I have
no recollection: I may have felt vaguely dissatisfied,
but I did not consciously allow myself to
criticize the purposeless existence I was leading.
At Waterloo Station we changed from one train
to another for the final stage of our ‘through’
journey. On account of her feeling unwell Aunt
Evelyn had taken first-class tickets, and this made
me conscious that we had a social position to keep
up. Gratified by the obsequious attentions of the
green-flagged guard, I couldn’t help wishing that
my aunt had tipped him more than a shilling. As
she remarked, he was such a very nice-mannered
man, and I assumed that he was expecting half a
crown.</p>

<p class="pindent">At any rate, it was a relief to settle down in a
corner of the dark blue cushioned compartment
after my aunt’s unnecessary fussification about the
luggage. Rain-drops trickled down the windows
as we steamed out of the station, and I was glad
to avert my gaze from the dingy and dilapidated
tenements and warehouses which we were passing.
Poverty was a thing I hated to look in the face; it
was like the thought of illness and bad smells, and
I resented the notion of all those squalid slums
spreading out into the uninfected green country.
While I perused a magazine called <span class="it">Golf Illustrated</span>
I stole an occasional glance at the two very
first-class looking passengers who occupied the
other corners of the compartment. One of them
was a grey-haired lady with a crocodile-skin dressing-case
and a fur cloak. She was reading a book
with an air of refined hauteur. The other was a
middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed grey
beard and a glossy top-hat which he had ceremoniously
arranged on the rack above him. He was
glancing at <span class="it">Blackwood’s Magazine</span>, and he had a
bunch of violets in the buttonhole of his opulent
dark blue overcoat. From the tone of voice in
which he inquired whether she would prefer the
window down a little I inferred that the lady was
a stranger to him. Compared with these influential-looking
people, Aunt Evelyn in her countrified
tweed coat and skirt and her dowdy little hat
seemed only just presentable. I had yet to make
the significant discovery that the most distinguished
personages are sometimes the most untidy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fortunately for her peace of mind, my aunt was
much too tired to worry about the impression
which her exterior might be creating on two complete
strangers who were surveying her for the
first and probably the last time on earth. What
she really cared about was a cup of hot tea. But
we should be in the train another hour, and we
couldn’t possibly get home before six o’clock.
Aunt Evelyn, however, though she seldom travelled,
was not without resourcefulness in the matter
of railway journeys, and what she didn’t know
about picnics wasn’t worth knowing. Now among
the numerous light articles which she had brought
into the carriage there was a certain plebeian-looking
basket which contained every facility for
making tea. Most essential among the facilities
was a patent spirit-lamp for boiling the water;
and this lamp was apt to misbehave itself and
produce an unpleasing smell. Had we been alone
I should have been willing enough to set it alight,
and the whole business would have been quite companionable
and cosy. But now, with those impeccably
dressed people in their corners, I felt nothing
except discomfort and disapproval when my aunt
became busy with her basket. I totally dissociated
myself from her preparations, while she muddled
about with the lamp, which for some time refused
to function and then flared up with sudden explosive
ardour.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was quite afraid it was going to be tiresome,”
she remarked, screening it with the <span class="it">Pall Mall
Gazette</span> and looking across at me with a smile.
But the expected response was absent. I glowered
contemptuously at the apparatus which she
had placed on the floor. She then began measuring
out the tea. In the meantime I was conscious
that our fellow travellers were exchanging scandalized
glances, and their haughtiness intensified itself
with every phase of the capricious conduct of the
lamp.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There now! It’s gone out again!” exclaimed
Aunt Evelyn, who had become slightly flustered,
since she had observed that she was getting herself
into bad odour with the other passengers.</p>

<p class="pindent">By dint of striking several more matches and
much twiddling of the wick she got the conflagration
well under way again, although she had some
difficulty in shielding it against a dangerous
draught caused by the gentleman, who had let
down his window with expostulating asperity.</p>

<p class="pindent">As for me, I considered that Aunt Evelyn was
making a regular exhibition of herself, and when
her persistence had been rewarded by a cloud of
steam and she held out a cup of moderately hot
China tea, I felt so annoyed that I could almost
have chucked it out of the window. However, I
expressed my feelings adequately by muttering,
“No, <span class="it">I</span> don’t want any,” and putting my paper
up as a barrier between myself and the objectionable
sight of Aunt Evelyn sipping her tea with
mechanical enjoyment. As there was a spare cup
in the basket she politely said to the lorgnette-raising
lady, “May I offer you a cup of tea,
madam?” But the amenity was declined with an
air of social remoteness.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the remainder of the journey I couldn’t
bring myself to say another word, and Aunt
Evelyn endured my sulky silence—wearily apologetic.
By the time we were home I knew quite
clearly that my attitude toward the tea-making
had been odious; and the more I realized it the
more impossible it seemed for me to make amends
by behaving gently to her. It was one of those
outwardly trivial episodes which one does not
forget.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was now an accepted fact that I had quitted
Cambridge University. During the autumn I
was limply incorporating myself with Aunt
Evelyn’s localized existence. Nothing was being
said on the subject of what I was going to do, and
I cannot remember that the problem was perplexing
my thoughts, or that I felt any hankerings for
more eventful departments of human experience.
I was content to take it easy until something happened.
But since I had no responsibilities and no
near relatives except my aunt, whose connection
with the world beyond her own ‘round of calls’
was confined to a few old friends who seldom wrote
to her, the things which could happen were humdrum
and few.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are you doing to-day, George?” asks
Aunt Evelyn, as she gets up from the breakfast
table to go down to the kitchen to interview the
cook.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, I shall probably bike over to Amblehurst
after lunch for a round of golf,” I reply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Over at Amblehurst, about four miles away,
there is a hazardless nine-hole course round Squire
Maundle’s sheep-nibbled park. The park faces
south-west, sloping to a friendly little river—the
Neaze—which at that point, so I have been told,
though I never trouble to verify it—divides the
counties of Kent and Sussex. On the other side
of the river is the village. Squire Maundle’s clanging
stable clock shares with the belfry of the village
school the privilege of indicating the Amblehurst
hours. My progress up and down the park from
one undersized green to another is accompanied
by the temperate clamour of sheep-bells (and in
springtime by the loud litanies of baa-ing lambs
and anxious ewes). The windows of Squire
Maundle’s eighteenth-century mansion overlook
my zigzag saunterings with the air of a county
family dowager who has not yet made up her
mind to leave cards on those new people at the
Priory. As a rule, I have the links to myself, but
once in a while ‘young’ Squire Maundle (so-called
because his eighty-seven-year-old father is
still above ground) appears on the skyline in his
deer-stalker hat, with a surly black retriever at his
heels, and we play an amicable round.</p>

<p class="pindent">Without wishing to ridicule him, for he was always
kind and courteous, I may say that both his
features and his tone of voice have something in
common with the sheep who lift their mild munching
faces to regard him while he plays an approach
shot in his cautious, angular, and automatic style.
He is one of those shrewdly timorous men who are
usually made a butt of by their more confident associates.
Falstaff would have borrowed fifty
pounds off him, though he has the reputation of
being close with his money. His vocabulary is as
limited as his habit of mind, and he speaks with an
old-fashioned, word-clipping conciseness. His lips
are pursed up as if in a perpetual whistle. The
links—on which he knows every tussock and mole-hill
intimately—are always “in awful good condition”;
and “That’s a hot ’un!” he exclaims when I
make a long drive, or “That’s for Sussex!” (a
reference to the remote possibility that my ball may
have gone over the river). But the best instance
I can give of his characteristic mode of expressing
himself is one which occurred when I once questioned
him about a group of little grey stones
among the laurel bushes outside his stable-yard.
After whistling to his retriever he replied, “House-dogs
bury in the shrubbery: shooting-dogs bury in
the park.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn always enjoyed a game of croquet
with him at a garden party.</p>

<p class="pindent">But in my spontaneous memories of Amblehurst
I am always playing by myself. The sun is in my
eyes as I drive off at the ‘long hole’ down to the
river, and I usually slice my ball into a clump of
may trees. I am ‘trying to do a good score’—a
purpose which seldom survives the first nine holes—but
only half my attention is concentrated on
the game. I am wondering, perhaps, whether that
parcel from the second-hand bookshop at Reading
will have arrived by the afternoon post; or I am
vaguely musing about my money affairs; or thinking
what a relief it is to have escaped from the
tyranny of my Tripos at Cambridge. Outside the
park the village children are making a shrill hub-bub
as they come out of school. But the sun is
reddening beyond the straight-rising smoke of the
village chimneys, and I must sling my clubs across
my shoulder and mount my bicycle to pedal my
way along the narrow autumn-smelling lanes. And
when I get home Aunt Evelyn will be there to
pour out my tea and tell me all about the Jumble
Sale this afternoon; it was such a success, they
made more than six pounds for the Mission to
Deep-Sea Fishermen.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The days were drawing in, though it was only
the second week in October.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a nice fire up in the schoolroom, Mr.
George; and a parcel of books come by the carrier’s
van,” said Miriam, when she was taking away
the tea things.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miriam (and I might well have mentioned her
before, since she had already been with Aunt
Evelyn for nearly seven years) was a gaunt woman
who had looked more than middle-aged ever since
I first saw her. Miriam’s hair had perhaps begun
by being golden, but it was now a faded yellow
remnant, drawn tightly back from her broad forehead
and crowned by a skimpy lace cap. Her
wide-set eyes had a strained and patient expression,
as though expecting to be rather sharply
ordered to lug a heavy scuttle of coals up four
flights of steep stairs. She was unobtrusively
humpbacked and round shouldered, which suggested
that when not carrying scuttles upstairs she
had been burdened with heavy trays or had been
stooping over a scullery sink to wash and wipe a
lifetime of crockery. Her voice, too, had a long-suffering
note in it—most noticeable when she was
doing her best to be gay. These outward characteristics
were the only legacy which she had received
from her late mistress who had for a long period
of years exploited Miriam’s abnormal willingness
for work. In such drudgery she had used up her
youth and maturity, thereby acquiring an habitual
capacity for taking on her own shoulders a load of
domestic duties which never seemed to have struck
her as being excessive. She was what is known as
‘a treasure.’ The difficulty, as Aunt Evelyn
often said, was to persuade her to sit down and
shut her eyes for a few minutes and allow the other
maids to do their fair share of the housework.
But Aunt Evelyn’s kindness only stimulated
Miriam to renewed activity, and her response to
ordinary civility and consideration reflected no
credit at all on her former employer. In those
days I used to look upon her as a bit of a joke,
and I took for granted the innumerable little jobs
she did for me. She was no more than an odd-looking
factotum, whose homely methods and manners
occasionally incurred my disapproval, for I
had a well-developed bump of snobbishness as regards
flunkeydom and carriage-and-pair ostentation
as a whole. Now and again, however, I was
remotely affected by the smile which used to light
up her sallow humble face when I said something
which pleased her. It is the memory of that smile
which has helped me to describe her. For there
was a loveliness of spirit in her which I did not
recognize until it was too late for her to know it.</p>

<p class="line0" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">On my way up to the schoolroom, which had
formerly been known as ‘the day-nursery,’ I decided
that the name needed further promotion.
‘Study’ was inappropriate and sounded elderly.
‘Smoking-room’ wouldn’t do either, because I
hadn’t begun smoking yet, although puffing my
pipe by the fireside on winter evenings was a comfortable
idea. ‘Library,’ I thought (pausing in
the dark passage with a hand on the brass doorknob),
was too big a jump from ‘schoolroom.’
Besides, there wasn’t any library. ‘Library’
meant glass-fronted bookcases with yellow busts
of Julius Caesar and Cicero on the top. Entering
the fire-lit room, I pounced on the bulky
package which Miriam had deposited on the table.
‘Book-room,’ I thought, as I tugged impetuously
at the thick string. And ‘book-room’ it
rather tentatively became.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no doubt that I had a fondness for
books—especially old ones. But my reading was
desultory and unassimilative. Words made a
muddled effect on my mind while I was busy
among them, and they seldom caused any afterthoughts.
I esteemed my books mostly for their
outsides. I admired old leather bindings, and my
fancy was tickled by the thought of firelight flickering
on dim gilt, autumn-coloured backs—rows
and rows of them, and myself in an arm-chair
musing on the pleasant names of Addison and
Steele, Gibbon and Goldsmith. And what wonderful
bargains were to be discovered in the catalogues
of second-hand booksellers at Birmingham!
Only last week I had acquired (for seven and sixpence)
<span class="it">Dr. Burnet’s Rights of Princes in the Disposing
of Ecclesiastical Benefices, 1685</span>. <span class="sc">First
Edition.</span> <span class="it">Original sheep</span>, scarce. And there were
Tillotson’s Sermons, ten imposing volumes in sage
green morocco. I had bought them along with a
twelve-volume edition of Doctor Johnson’s Works
(in contemporary sprinkled calf), and had even
read a few of the shorter <span class="it">Lives of the Poets</span> (such
as Garth, Broome, Mallet, and Sprat). I had also
made a short-winded effort to read <span class="it">Rasselas</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now (disentangling the cord and rending
the brown paper wrappings) Pope’s <span class="it">Homer</span> had
actually arrived. Six folio volumes, first edition,
and they had only cost fifteen bob plus the postage.
When I wrote for them (to a philanthropist
named Cowler, at Reading) I made sure that
someone else would have snapped them up. But
no; here they were; in quite good condition, too.
And how splendid, to be able to read both Pope
and Homer at once! Homer had been impossible
to enjoy in the fifth form at Ballboro’, but he
would seem ever so much easier now. I resolved
to read exactly a hundred lines every day until I’d
waded through the whole six volumes. And when
I’d marshalled them on the top shelf—for they
were too tall to fit into any other—between the
quarto sets of Smollett’s <span class="it">History of England</span> and
Tickell’s <span class="it">Addison</span>, I solemnly abstracted the first
volume of the Iliad and made a start.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> those who are expecting to see me in the
saddle again it may seem that I have delayed
over-long in acquiring my first hunter. But I take
this opportunity of reminding my invisible audience
that there was no imperative reason why I
should ever have bought a horse at all; in fact,
candour compels me to confess that if I had been
left to my own devices I should probably have
spent the forty-five guineas on something else.
For though I was living so quietly and paying
Aunt Evelyn nothing for my keep, I never seemed
to have much of a balance at the bank. And Mr.
Pennett, who appeared to consider me utterly irresponsible
in matters of money, had so far refused
to disgorge more than £450 a year out of my estimated
income of £600. So, what with buying
books and a new bicycle, and various other apparently
indispensable odds and ends, I found
myself ‘going in for economy’ when early in
January Dixon began his campaign to revive my
interest in the stable.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the winter I had been taking a walk
every afternoon. I usually went five or six miles,
but they soon became apathetic ones, and I was
conscious of having no genuine connection with the
countryside. Other people owned estates, or rented
farms, or did something countrified; but I only
walked along the roads or took furtive short cuts
across the fields of persons who might easily have
bawled at me if they had caught sight of me. And
I felt shy and ‘out of it’ among the local land-owners—most
of whose conversation was about
shooting. So I went mooning, more and more
moodily, about the looming landscape, with its
creaking-cowled hop-kilns and whirring flocks of
starlings and hop-poles piled in pyramids like soldiers’
tents. Often when I came home for five
o’clock tea I felt a vague desire to be living somewhere
else—in 1850, for instance, when everything
must have been so comfortable and old-fashioned,
like the Cathedral Close in Trollope’s novels. The
weather was too bad for golf, and even ‘young’
Squire Maundle was obliged to admit that the
Amblehurst course was in far from first-rate condition.
And there never seemed to be any reason
for going to London, although, of course, there
were interesting things to see there: (Aunt Evelyn
was always intending to run up for the day and go
to a matinee of Beerbohm Tree’s new Shakespearean
production).</p>

<p class="pindent">I seldom spoke to anyone while I was out for
my walks, but now and again I would meet John
Homeward, the carrier, on his way back from the
county town where he went three days a week.
Homeward was a friendly man; I always ‘passed
the time of day’ with him. He was a keen cricketer
and one of Dixon’s chief cronies. The weather and
next year’s cricket were the staple topics of our
conversation. Homeward had been making his
foot-pace journeys with his hooded van and nodding
horse ever since I could remember, and he
seemed an essential feature of the ten miles across
the Weald to Ashbridge (a somnolent town which
I associated with the smell of a brewery and the
grim fact of people being hung in the gaol there).
All the year round, whether there was snow on the
ground or blossom on the fruit trees, the carrier’s
van crawled across the valley with its cargo of
utilities, but Homeward was always alone with his
horse, for he never took passengers. In my mind’s
eye he is invariably walking beside his van, for he
always got out at the steep hill which winds down
to the Weald. His burly figure and kindly
bearded face must have gone up and down that hill
about five thousand times before he retired to
prosper with a small public-house. I used to wonder
what he thought about while on the road, for
he had the look of a man who was cogitant rather
than vegetative. Dixon told me that he spent his
whole time weighing the pros and cons of the half-crown
bets which he made on races. In matters
connected with the Turf he was a compendium of
exact knowledge, and his profession allowed him
ample leisure to make up his mind about likely outsiders
and nicely handicapped horses at short odds.</p>

<p class="pindent">Another feature of the local landscape was Joey,
who worked on the roads, mostly at flint-breaking.
I never knew his real name, though I’d known him
by sight ever since I could remember. He was a
lizard-faced man and the skin of his throat hung
loose and shrivelled. I had named him Joey—in
my mind—after a tortoise which I had owned
when I was a child. Sitting on a heap of stones on
the main road, alone with the humming telegraph
poles and the clack of his hammer, he always
saluted me as I passed, but I never conversed with
him and he never seemed to get any older. He
might have been any age between forty and
seventy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">But I must hurry myself along a bit, for it is
high time that I was on the back of my new hunter.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">On New Year’s Day I was half-pedestrian and
half-bicyclist, with no idea of being anything else.
Within a week I found myself a full-blown horse-owner,
and was watching Dixon exert himself with
a hammer and chisel as he opened the neat wooden
case which contained a new saddle from that old-established
West End firm, Campion &amp; Webble.
The responsibility for these stimulating occurrences
rested with Dixon.</p>

<p class="pindent">One morning after breakfast Miriam announced
that Dixon had something he particularly wished
to speak to me about and was waiting in the servants’
hall. Wondering what on earth it would be,
I asked her to send him up to the book-room. I
was there before him; a minute or two later the
sound of his deliberate tread was audible in the
passage; he knocked portentously and entered respectfully,
introducing a faint odour of the stables.
He had an air of discreetly subdued excitement
and there was a slight flush about the cheekbones
of his keen face. Without delay he produced a
copy of <span class="it">Horse and Hound</span> from his pocket, unfolded
it carefully, and handed it to me, merely
saying, “I want you to have a look at <span class="it">that</span>, sir.”
<span class="it">That</span>, as indicated by his thumb, was the following
item in Tattersall’s weekly sale list.</p>

<p class="pindent">“The Property of Cosmo Gaffikin, Esq., Harkaway
III. Chestnut gelding; aged; sixteen hands;
a good hunter; an exceptionally brilliant performer;
well known with the Dumborough
Hounds, with whom he has been regularly hunted
to date. Can be seen and ridden by appointment
with Stud Groom, Mistley House, Wellbrook.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I read the advertisement in a stupefied way, but
Dixon allowed me no time for hesitation or demur.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It struck me, sir, that you might do worse than
go over and have a look at him,” he remarked,
adding, “I saw him run in the Hunt Cup two years
ago; he’s a very fine stamp of hunter.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Did he win?” I asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, sir. But he ran well, and I think Mr.
Gaffikin made too much use of him in the first mile
or two.” For lack of anything to say I reread
the advertisement.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, sir, if you’ll excuse my saying so, you
don’t get a chance like that every day.”</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later Dixon had got me into the dog-cart
and was driving me over to Wellbrook—a
distance of ten miles. It was a mild, grey morning,
and as I felt that I had lost control over what was
happening, there was no need to feel nervous about
the impending interview. In response to my tentative
inquiries Dixon displayed a surprisingly intimate
knowledge of everything connected with
Harkaway and his present owner, and when I suggested
that the price expected would be too high
for me, he went so far as to say that he had very
good reason to believe that he could be bought for
fifty pounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">When we arrived at Mistley House it soon became
clear even to my unsuspicious mind that the
stud groom had been expecting us. When Harkaway
was led out of his stable my first impression
was of a noticeably narrow animal with a white
blaze on his well-bred and intelligent face. But I
felt more impelled to admire than to criticize, and
a few minutes later Mr. Gaffikin himself came clattering
into the stable-yard on a jaunty black mare
with a plaited mane. The stud groom explained
me as “Mr. Sherston, sir; come over from Butley
to have a look at Harkaway, sir.” Mr. Gaffikin
was about thirty-five and had a rather puffy face
and a full-sized brown moustache. He was good-humoured
and voluble and slangy and easygoing,
and very much the sportsman. He had nothing
but praise for Harkaway, and seemed to feel the
keenest regret at parting with him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“But the fact is,” he explained confidentially,
“the old horse isn’t quite up to my weight and I
want to make room for a young ’chaser. But
you’re a stone lighter than I am, and he’d carry you
like a bird—like a bird, wouldn’t you, old chap?”—and
he pulled Harkaway’s neat little ears affectionately.
“Yes,” he went on, “I don’t mind
telling you he’s the boldest performer I’ve ever
been on. Nailing good hunter. I’ve never known
him turn his head. Absolute patent-safety; I can
guarantee you that much, Mr. Sherston.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Whereupon he urged me to jump on the old
horse’s back and see how I liked the feel of him.
(He used the adjective “old” as if in the case of
Harkaway age was an immensely valuable quality.)
Conscious of the disparity between my untidy
grey flannel trousers and Mr. Gaffikin’s miraculously
condensed white gaiters and perfectly cut
brown breeches, I clambered uncouthly into the
saddle. As I jogged out of the yard I felt myself
unworthy of my illustrious conveyance. Conscious
of the scrutiny of the experts whose eyes were upon
me, I also felt that Mr. Gaffikin was conferring a
privilege on me in affording me this facility for
making up my mind about “the old horse.” When
I had been down to the gate and back again everyone
agreed that Harkaway and myself were admirably
suited to one another.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m asking fifty for him—and he’d probably
make a bit more than that at Tatt’s. But I’m
awful keen to find the old chap a really good home,
and I’d be glad to let you have him for forty-five,”
Mr. Gaffikin assured me, adding, “Forty-five
<span class="it">guineas</span>: it’s very little for a horse of his class, and
he’s got many a hard season in him yet.” I agreed
that the price was extremely moderate. “Well,
you must come in and have a bit of lunch, and then
we can talk it over.” But it was obvious that the
transaction was as good as concluded, and Dixon
had already made up his mind to put a bit more
flesh on the old horse before he was much older.</p>

<p class="pindent">That evening I composed a mildly defiant letter
to Mr. Pennett, explaining that I had found it
necessary to buy a horse, and asking him to provide
me with an extra fifty pounds.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The arrival of Harkaway was a red-letter day
for our uneventful household. Dixon and I had
agreed to say nothing about it to Aunt Evelyn, so
there was a genuine surprise when we were finishing
our lunch two days later and Miriam almost
fell through the dining-room door with a startled
expression on her face and exclaimed, “Oh, sir,
your horse has come, and he don’t half look a
beauty!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good gracious, George, you don’t mean to tell
me you’ve bought a horse?” said Aunt Evelyn, fluttering
up out of her chair and hastening to the
window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sure enough, there was Harkaway with Dixon
on his back, and we all three went outside to admire
him. Aunt Evelyn accepted his advent with
unqualified approval, and remarked that he had
“such a benevolent eye.” Dixon, of course, was
beaming with satisfaction. Miriam hovered on the
doorstep in a state of agitated enthusiasm. And
altogether it seemed as if I had accomplished
something creditable. Self-satisfied and proprietary,
I stroked the old horse’s neck, and felt as
though in him, at least, I had an ally against the
arrogance of the world which so often oppressed
me with a sense of my inferiority. But the red-letter
day was also a lawyer’s letter day. My
complacency was modified by Mr. Pennett’s reply,
which arrived in the evening. When I had carried
it upstairs and digested it I had an uncomfortable
feeling that the schoolroom was still the
schoolroom in spite of its new and more impressive
name. In fairness to the writer I must again quote
his letter <span class="it">in toto</span>, as he would have phrased it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Dear George, I confess I am disappointed with
your letter. £450 a year is a big sum and should
be more than ample for <span class="it">all</span> your requirements. I
do not propose to comment on the fact that you
have found it necessary to buy a horse, although
I am not surprised that you find that time hangs
heavy on your hands. When I last saw you I told
you that in my view the best thing you could do
would be to qualify to be called to the Bar, that you
should go into a barrister’s chambers and work
there steadily until you were called. The training
is excellent, it gives you an insight into business
matters, and enables you to acquire the power of
steady concentration. I have also intimated to you
as strongly as I could that you are wasting your
time and energies in pursuing a course of desultory
reading. I consider it a shame that a young fellow
with your health and strength and more than average
amount of brains should be content to potter
around and not take up some serious calling and
occupation. I venture to prophesy that this will
one day be brought home to you and perhaps too
late. My view is, ‘Don’t ride the high horse.’ He
won’t carry you across country and the chances
are you will come a cropper at your fences. Yours
sincerely, Percival G. Pennett. P.S.—£50 is a
large sum to spend for the object you propose. I
am therefore paying into your account £35, which
sum will be deducted from the next instalment of
your income.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Dismissing the idea of working steadily in a
barrister’s chambers, which was too unpalatable to
be dwelt on, however briefly, I wondered whether
the truth of Mr. Pennett’s prophecy would ever
be ‘brought home to me.’ It was a nuisance
about the money, though; but Harkaway had been
brought home to me, anyhow. So I consolidated
my position by writing out a cheque to Cosmo
Gaffikin, Esq., there and then. After that I erected
an additional barrier against the lawyer’s attack
on my liberties by settling down to a steady perusal
of <span class="it">Mr. Sponge’s Sporting Tour</span>, which I had
brought up from the drawing-room. And while
I relished Mr. Sponge’s desultory adventures I
made up my mind to go out with the Dumborough
Hounds as soon as I felt myself qualified to appear
in public on my exceptionally brilliant performer.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">If Mr. Pennett could have prevented me from
purchasing Harkaway (or any other quadruped)
he would have done so. It was his mundane duty
as my ex-guardian and acting trustee. Nor can it
be denied that Dixon’s loyalty to his profession
required him to involve me as inextricably as possible
in all that concerned the equine race. Dixon
had emerged victorious. A raw youth who refuses
to read for the Bar is persuaded by the family
groom to buy a horse. How tame it sounds! But
there was a lot more in it than that—a statement
which can be applied to many outwardly trivial
events in life when one takes the trouble to investigate
them. And while I am still at the outset of
my career as a fox-hunting man, I may as well
explain Dixon’s method of collaborating with me
in my progress toward proficiency. When I made
my fresh start and began to ride the gallant old
chestnut about the wintry lanes I was inwardly
awake to the fact that I knew next to nothing
about horses and hunting and was an indifferent
rider. And Dixon knew it as well as I did. But
his policy was to watch me learn to find my way
about the fox-hunting world, supplementing my
ignorance from his own experience in an unobtrusive
manner. He invariably allowed me to pretend
that I knew much more than I really did. It was
a delicately adjusted, mutual understanding. I
seldom asked him a straight question or admitted
any ignorance, and he taught me by referring to
things as though I already knew them. I can remember
no instance when he failed in this tactful
behavior and his silences were beyond praise.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile I am still reading <span class="it">Mr. Sponge</span> in the
schoolroom. But it must not be supposed that I
launched myself in the hunting-field with unpremeditative
temerity. Far from it. It was all very
well to be reading about how Mr. Sponge bought
a new pair of top-boots in Oxford Street sixty
years ago. But the notion of my inexpert self acquiring
such unfamiliar accoutrements seemed
problematic and audacious. My trepidation
blinded me to the obvious fact that bootmakers
were willing and even eager, to do their best for
me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed dressing up as a
sportsman, and the box-cloth gaiters which I had
bought in Ashbridge were a source of considerable
satisfaction when they encased my calves, and
Miriam’s long-suffering face looked in at the book-room
door with “Your horse, sir”—for Dixon
liked to bring the horse round to the front door
when I was going out for a ride.</p>

<p class="pindent">I always went out alone, for the driving horse
was a nonentity and seldom appeared without the
dog-cart. Also, as I have already explained, I was
making my equestrian experiment without active
interference or supervision. When I got home
again Dixon would ask, “Did he go all right?”
and I would hang about the loose-box while Harkaway
was being rubbed down. I always had a few
things to tell Dixon about my two hours’ exercise—how
I’d been through the Hookham woods and
had given him a nice gallop, and how I’d jumped
the hedge by Dunk’s Windmill on the way home
(it was a very small hedge, and I lost a stirrup and
very nearly fell off, but there was no need to mention
that). And then we would agree that the old
horse was looking grand and improving every day.
It was also agreed that Mr. Gaffikin must have
given him a pretty thick time out hunting and that
a spell of easy work would do him all the good in
the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">Until the middle of February his reappearance
with the hounds was not referred to. But one
afternoon (when I had modestly admitted that we
had jumped a small stile when taking the short cut
between Clay Hill and Marl Place) Dixon interrupted
his hissing to look up at me, and said in
his most non-committal tone, “I see they’re meeting
at Finchurst Green on Tuesday.” The significance
of this remark was unmistakeable. The
next day I bicycled to Ashbridge and bought a
pair of ready-made ‘butcher-boots.’</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Of all the pairs of hunting-boots which I have
ever owned, the Ashbridge pair remain vividly in
my mind as a long way the worst. Judged by the
critical standard which I have since acquired, their
appearance was despicable. This was equalled by
the difficulty of struggling into them, and the discomfort
they caused while I wore them. Any
long-legged ‘thruster’ will tell you that a smart
pair of boots is bound to cause trouble for the first
few days. It is the penalty of smartness. (And I
have heard of a young man with a broken ankle
who, though almost fainting with the pain of his
boot being pulled off, was able to gasp out—“Don’t
cut it; they’re the best pair Craxwell’s ever
made for me.”) But the Ashbridge boots, when I
started for Finchurst Green, hung spurless on
each side of Harkaway, stiff, ill-shaped, and
palpably provincial in origin. And for some
reason known only to their anonymous maker,
they persistently refused to ‘take a polish.’ Their
complexion was lustreless and clammy, although
Aunt Evelyn’s odd man had given them all the
energy of his elbow. But it wasn’t until I had
surreptitiously compared them with other boots
that I realized their shortcomings (one of the
worst of which was their lack of length in the leg).
A boot can look just as silly as a human being.</p>

<p class="pindent">However, I had other anxieties as I rode to the
meet, for I was no less shy and apprehensive than
I had been on my way to the same place ten years
earlier. At the meet I knew no one except Mr.
Gaffikin, who came oscillating up to me, resplendent
in his pink coat and wearing a low-crowned
‘coachy’ hat cocked jauntily over his right ear.
After greeting me with the utmost geniality and
good-fellowship, he fell into a portentous silence;
bunching up his moustache under his fleshy nose
with an air of profound cogitation and knowingness,
he cast his eye over Harkaway. When he
had concluded this scrutiny he looked up and
unforeseeably ejaculated, “Is that a Sowter?”
This incomprehensible question left me mute. He
leant forward and lifted the flap of my saddle
which enabled me to blurt out, “I got it from Campion
and Webble.” (Sowter, as I afterwards discovered,
is a saddle-maker long established and
highly esteemed.) Mr. Gaffikin then gratified me
greatly by his approval of Harkaway’s appearance.
In fact, he’d “never seen the old horse looking
fitter.” During the day I found that the old
horse was acting as my passport into the Dumborough
Hunt, and quite a number of people eyed
him with pleased recognition, and reiterated his
late owner’s encomiums about his condition.</p>

<p class="pindent">But as it was a poor day’s sport and we were in
the woods nearly all the time, my abilities were
not severely tested, and I returned home satisfied
with the first experiment. Harkaway was not a
difficult horse to manage, but I did wish he would
walk properly. He was a most jogglesome animal
to ride on the roads, especially when his head was
toward his stable.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Three nondescript days with the Dumborough
were all the hunting I did on Harkaway during
the remainder of that season. But the importance
which I attached to the proceedings made me feel
quite an accredited fox-hunter by the time Dixon
had blistered Harkaway’s legs and roughed him
off in readiness for turning him out in the orchard
for the summer. The back tendon of his near
foreleg was causing a certain anxiety. February
ended with some sharp frosts, sharp enough to
make hunting impossible; and then there was a
deluge of rain which caused the country to be
almost unrideable. The floods were out along the
Weald, and the pollard willows by the river were
up to their waists in water.</p>

<p class="pindent">On one of my expeditions, after a stormy night,
at the end of March, the hounds drew all day without
finding a fox. This was my first experience of
a ‘blank day.’ But I wasn’t as much upset about
it as I ought to have been, for the sun was shining
and the primrose bunches were brightening in the
woods. Not many people spoke to me, so I was
able to enjoy hacking from one covert to another
and acquiring an appetite for my tea at the ‘Blue
Anchor.’ And after that it was pleasant to be
riding home in the latening twilight; to hear the
‘chink-chink’ of thrushes against the looming leafless
woods and the afterglow of sunset; and to
know that winter was at an end. Perhaps the old
horse felt it, too, for he had settled into the rhythm
of an easy striding walk instead of his customary
joggle.</p>

<p class="pindent">I can see the pair of us clearly enough; myself,
with my brow-pinching bowler hat tilted on to the
back of my head, staring, with the ignorant face
of a callow young man, at the dusky landscape
and its glimmering wet fields. And Harkaway
with his three white socks caked with mud, his
‘goose-rump,’ and his little ears cocked well forward.
I can hear the creak of the saddle and the
clop and clink of hoofs as we cross the bridge over
the brook by Dundell Farm; there is a light burning
in the farmhouse window, and the evening star
glitters above a broken drift of half-luminous
cloud. “Only three miles more, old man,” I say,
slipping to the ground to walk alongside of him
for a while.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is with a sigh that I remember simple
moments such as those, when I understood so little
of the deepening sadness of life, and only the
strangeness of the spring was knocking at my
heart.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>&nbsp;was now</span> eager to find out all I could about
riding and hunting, and it was with this object
in view that I made up my mind to go to the Ringwell
Hunt Point-to-Point Races. I had already
been to the Dumborough Hunt Steeplechase on
Easter Monday and had seen Mr. Gaffikin ride a
whirlwind finish on his black mare. He was
beaten by half a length, and I lost ten shillings.
Even to my inexperienced eyes it seemed as if he
was far too busy with his arms and legs as he came
up the straight. He appeared to be trying to go
much faster than his mount, and the general effect
differed from what I had seen described in sporting
novels, where the hero never moved in his
saddle until a few strides from the post, when he
hit his thoroughbred once and shot home a winner.</p>

<p class="pindent">What with the crowds jostling in front of the
bellowing bookmakers, the riders in their coloured
jackets thrashing their horses over the fences, and
the dress and demeanour of the sporting gentlefolk,
there was a ferocity in the atmosphere of
Dumborough Races which made me unable to
imagine myself taking an active part in such proceedings,
although it was obviously the thing to
do, and to win such a race as the Hunt Cup would
be a triumph to which I could not even aspire.</p>

<p class="pindent">So I went home feeling more warned than
edified, and it was a relief to be reading Tennyson
in my room while the birds warbled outside in the
clear April evening, and the voice of Aunt Evelyn
called to one of her cats across the lawn. But I
still wanted to go to the Ringwell Point-to-Points,
for Dixon had said that it was ‘a real old-fashioned
affair,’ and from the little I had seen and
heard of the Ringwell country I had got an idea
that it was a jolly, Surtees-like sort of Hunt, and
preferable to the Dumborough.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Ringwell Hunt was on the other side of the
Dumborough; its territory was almost double as
large, and it was a four-day-a-week country,
whereas the Dumborough only went out on Tuesdays
and Saturdays. The races were being held
about three miles from Downfield, the county
town, which was in the middle of the Ringwell
country. So in order to get there I had to bicycle
nearly seven miles and then make the twenty-five
mile train journey from Dumborough to Downfield.
It was a journey which subsequently became
tediously familiar, but it felt almost adventurous
on the fine mid-April day which I am
describing.</p>

<p class="pindent">In deference to the horsey events which I was
intent on witnessing, I was wearing my box-cloth
gaiters, and as I bicycled out of the unhunted
Butley district I felt that I was indeed on my way
to a region where things really happened. In fact,
I might have been off to Melton Mowbray, so intense
were my expectations. As the train puffed
slowly into Sussex I eyed the densely wooded
Dumborough country disparagingly. At the
point where, so far as I could judge, there should
have been a noticeable improvement, the landscape
failed to adapt itself to my anticipations.
The train had entered Ringwell territory, but
there was still a great deal of woodland and little
open country.</p>

<p class="pindent">As we got nearer Downfield the country became
more attractive-looking, and I estimated every
fence we passed as if it had been put there for no
other purpose than to be jumped by Harkaway.
I had yet to become aware of the farmer’s point
of view. A large crowd of people riding over
someone else’s land and making holes in the hedges
is likely to create all sorts of trouble for the
Master of Hounds, but I had not thought of it in
that way. The country was there to be ridden
over. That was all. I knew that I ought to shut
the gates behind me (and some of them were an
awful nuisance to open, when Harkaway was excited),
but it had not occurred to me that a hole in
a fence through which fifty horses have blundered
is much the same as an open gate, so far as the
exodus of a farmer’s cattle is concerned. However,
this problem of trespassing by courtesy has
existed as long as fox-hunting, and it is not likely
to be solved until both the red-coated fraternity
and the red-furred carnivorous mammal which
they pursue have disappeared from England’s
green and pleasant land. But I was occupied
with my speculations about the point-to-point
course, and at Harcombe Mill, the last little station
before Downfield, I got out of the train,
lonely but light-hearted.</p>

<p class="pindent">The direction of the course was indicated by a
few gigs and other vehicles on the road, and by a
thin stream of pedestrians who were crossing some
upland fields by a footpath. When I came to the
crest of the hill I caught sight of some tents on a
tree-clustered knoll about a mile away, and the
course evidently made a big ring round this central
point. A red flag stuck on the top of an oak
tree was the only indication of a racecourse,
though here and there a hairy-looking hedge had
been trimmed for a space of a few yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">An elderly labourer was sitting in a ditch eating
his bread and cheese and I asked him which way
they went.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ay, it’s a tricky old course, and no mistake,”
he remarked, “and the ground be terrible heavy
down along the brook, as some of ’em’ll find afore
they’re much older.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Following his directions I made my way from
one obstacle to another, inspecting each one carefully.
Most of them looked alarming, and though
the brook was not quite so wide as I had expected,
it had boggy banks. As there was still plenty of
time before the first race I was able to go about
half-way round the course before I joined the
throng of people and carriages on the hillside.</p>

<p class="pindent">The course, though I was not aware of it at the
time, was one of the old-fashioned ‘sporting’ type,
and these races had a strong similarity to the original
point-to-point which was run over a ‘natural’
line of country, where the riders were told to make
their way to some conspicuous point and back
again as best they could. The Harcombe course
was ‘natural’ in so far as there were no flags stuck
in the fences, a fair proportion of which had been
left in that state which the farmer had allowed
them to assume. This type of course has now been
almost universally superseded by a much tamer
arrangement where the riders usually go twice
round a few fields, jumping about a dozen carefully
made-up fences which can be galloped over
like hurdles.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the cramped Harcombe course there were
nearly fifty obstacles to be surmounted, and most
of them were more suited to a clever hunter than
to an impetuous and ‘sketchy’ jumper. Consequently
these races were slower and more eventful
than the scurrying performances which in most
provincial hunts are still called point-to-point
races. A course of the Harcombe type, though
almost too interesting for many of the riders, had
grave disadvantages for the spectators, who saw
little except the start and the finish. But the
meeting had a distinctive character of its own—the
genuinely countrified flavour of a gathering
of local people.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I arrived at the centre of operations the
farmers and puppy-walkers were emerging from
the marquee where they had been entertained by
the Hunt, and their flushed, convivial faces contributed
to the appropriate atmosphere of the day.
They had drunk the Master’s health and were on
the best of terms with the world in general. Had
I been inside the tent as representative of the
<span class="it">Southern Daily News</span>, I should probably have reported
the conclusion of his speech in something
very like the following paragraph:</p>

<p class="pindent">“He was glad to say that they had had a highly
successful season. A plentiful supply of foxes
had been forthcoming and they had accounted for
fifty-eight and a half brace. They had also killed
three badgers. He would like to repeat what he
had said at the commencement of his speech,
namely, that it must never be forgotten that the
best friend of the fox-hunter was the farmer.
(Loud applause.) And he took the liberty of
saying that no hunt was more fortunate in its
farmers than the Ringwell Hunt. Their staunch
support of the hunt was something for which he
found it impossible to express his appreciation in
adequate terms. An almost equal debt of gratitude
was due to the Puppy Walkers, without
whose invaluable aid the hunstman’s task would
be impossible. Finally he asked them to do everything
in their power to eliminate the most dangerous
enemy of the hunting man—he meant barbed
wire. But he must not detain them any longer
from what promised to be a most interesting
afternoon’s sport; and amidst general satisfaction
he resumed his seat.”</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">I bought a race-card and went in the direction
of ‘the Paddock,’ which was a hurdled enclosure
outside some farm buildings. Several people
nodded to me in a friendly manner, which made
me feel more confident, although it puzzled me,
for I couldn’t remember that I had seen any of
them before. The first race was almost due to
start, and the bookmakers were creating a background
of excitement with their crescendo shoutings
of “Even money the Field” and “Two to one
bar one.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll lay five to one Monkey Tricks; five to one
Monkey Tricks,” announced a villainous-looking
man under a vast red umbrella—his hoarse and
strident voice taking advantage of a momentary
lull in the lung-bursting efforts of the ornaments
of his profession on either side of him. “Don’t
forget the Old Firm!” he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">Looking down from above the heads and shoulders
of their indecisive clients, the Old Firms
appeared to be urging the public to witness some
spectacle which was hidden by the boards on which
their names were gaudily displayed. The public,
however, seemed vaguely mistrustful and the
amount of business being done was not equivalent
to the hullaballoo which was inciting them to bet
their money.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a press of people outside the paddock;
a bell jangled, and already the upper halves
of two or three red- or black-coated riders could
be seen settling themselves in their saddles; soon
there was a cleavage in the crowd and the eight or
ten competitors filed out; their faces, as they
swayed past me, varied in expression, from lofty
and elaborate unconcern to acute and unconcealed
anxiety. But even the least impressive among the
cavalcade had an Olympian significance for my
gaze, and my heart beat faster in concurrence with
their mettlesome emergency, as they disappeared
through a gate in the wake of the starter, a burly,
jovial-faced man on a stumpy grey cob.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Having a ride to-day, sir?” asked a cadaverous
blue-chinned individual, who might have been
either a groom or a horse-dealer. Rather taken
aback by this complimentary inquiry, I replied
with a modest negation.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I see your brother’s riding Colonel Hesmon’s
old ’oss in the ’Eavy Weights. He might run well
in this deep going,” he continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">I did not disclaim the enigmatic relationship,
and he lowered his voice secretively. “I’m putting
a bit on Captain Reynard’s roan for this race!
I’ve heard that he’s very hot stuff.” And with a
cunning and confidential nod he elbowed his way
toward the line of bookmakers, who were now
doing a last brisk little turn of business before the
destination of the Light-Weight Cup was decided
over “Three and a half miles of fair hunting
country.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The card informed me that Lieut.-Col. C. M. F.
Hesmon’s Jerry was to be ridden by Mr. S. Colwood.
“It can’t be Stephen Colwood, can it?” I
thought, visualizing a quiet, slender boy with very
large hands and feet, who had come to my House
at Ballboro’ about two years after I went there.
Now I came to think of it his father had been a
parson in Sussex, but this did not seem to make
it any likelier that he should be riding in a race.</p>

<p class="pindent">At any rate, I wanted to see this Colwood, for
whose brother I had been mistaken, and after the
next race I walked boldly into the paddock to see
the horses being saddled for the Heavy Weights.
There were only five of them, and none of the five
looked like going very fast, though all were
obviously capable of carrying fourteen stone on
their backs. But since one of them had got to come
in first, their appearance was creating an amount
of interest quite disproportionate to their credentials
as racehorses, and their grooms and owners
were fussing around them as if they were running
in the Grand National.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve told the boy that if he wins I’ll <span class="it">give him
the horse</span>,” exclaimed an active little old gentleman
with a straggling grey moustache and a fawn-coloured
covert coat with large pearl buttons; his
hands were full of flat lead weights, which he kept
doling out to an elderly groom, who was inserting
them in the leather pouches of a cloth which was to
go under the saddle.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, the old fellow’s looking well, isn’t he?” he
went on, dropping another lump of lead into the
groom’s outstretched hand. “I don’t think I’ve
ever seen him look fitter than he does to-day.” He
gazed affectionately at the horse, a dark bay with
unclipped legs and a short untidily trimmed tail.</p>

<p class="pindent">People kept on coming up and greeting the
affable and excited owner with cordial civility and
he made the same remarks to each of them in turn.
“Yes, I’ve told the boy that if he wins I’ll <span class="it">give him
the horse</span>—are you quite sure those girths are all
right, Dumbrell?” (to the groom, who was continuing
his preparations with stoical deliberation),
“and ’pon my word I’m not at all sure he won’t
win—the old fellow’s fit to run for his life—never
saw him look better—and I know the boy’ll ride
him nicely—most promising boy—capital eye for
a country already—one of the keenest young chaps
I’ve ever known.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, Colonel, and how’s the old horse?” ejaculated
an exuberant person in a staring check suit
and a protuberant canary coloured waistcoat, extending
an immense red hand toward the little
man—who dropped the lead weights in a fluster
with “Ah, my dear chap, how are you—how are
you—delighted to see you”—followed by a reiteration
of his repertoire about ‘the boy’ and ‘the old
horse.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The fact that this was Lieut.-Col. C. M. F.
Hesmon was conveyed to me by the arrival of my
former schoolfellow Stephen Colwood. “Ah, there
you are, my boy—that’s capital,” said the Colonel,
moderating his agitation in order to adopt the
important demeanour of an owner giving his final
admonitions to a gallant young gentleman-rider.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen, who was wearing a pink silk cap and a
long-skirted black hunting-coat, silently received
from the groom the saddle and weight-cloth and
disappeared into the weighing tent, accompanied
by the Colonel, who was carrying a cargo of surplus
lead. When they reappeared Stephen looked
even more pale and serious than before. At the
best of times he had a somewhat meditative countenance,
but his face usually had a touch of whimsicality
about it, and this had been banished by the
tremendous events in which he was at present
involved.</p>

<p class="pindent">The combined efforts of Colonel and groom
were now solemnly adjusting the saddle and
weight-cloth (though it is possible that the assistance
of the Colonel might have been dispensed
with). Meanwhile the old hunter was standing as
quiet as a carriage horse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen was holding the bridle, and in the picture
which my memory retains of him at that
moment he is looking downward at the horse’s
lowered head with that sensitive and gentle expression
which was characteristic of him. It was nearly
three years since I had last set eyes on him, but I
had known him fairly well at school. As I watched
him now I felt almost as nervous as if I were about
to ride the Colonel’s horse myself. I assumed that
it was the first race he had ever ridden in, and I
knew that he was feeling that if anything went
wrong it would be entirely his own fault and that
he would never be able to look the Colonel in the
face again if he were to make a fool of himself.
And he had probably been suffering from such
apprehensions for several days beforehand. It
was not surprising that he patted Jerry’s philosophic
profile with a visibly shaking hand. Then
he looked up, and encountering my sympathetic
gaze his face lit up with recognition. It was a time
when he badly needed some such distraction, and
he at once made me feel that I was an opportune
intruder.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why, it’s old Sherston!” he exclaimed. “Fancy
you turning up like this!” And he gave me a wry
grin which privately conveyed his qualms.</p>

<p class="pindent">He told me afterwards that there were two
things which he wished at that moment: either that
the race was all over, or that something would
happen to prevent it taking place at all. It is
sometimes forgotten that without such feelings
heroism could not exist.</p>

<p class="pindent">He then made me known to the Colonel, who
greeted me with a mixture of formality and heartiness
and insisted that I must come round to his
brake and have a glass of port and a sandwich
after the race.</p>

<p class="pindent">It seemed as though my diffident arrival on the
scene had somehow relieved their anxieties, but a
moment later the stentorian voice of the starter
was heard saying, “Now, gentlemen, I’m going
down to the post,” and I stood back while Stephen
was given a leg-up by the groom. Then he bent
his head to hear the Colonel’s final injunctions
about “not making too much of the running” and
“letting him go his own pace at his fences,” ending
with a heartfelt valediction. Stephen was then
turned adrift with all his troubles in front of him.
No one could help him any more.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Hesmon looked almost forlorn when the
horse and his long-legged rider had vanished
through the crowd. He had the appearance of a
man who has been left behind. And as I see it
now, in the light of my knowledge of after-events,
there was a premonition in his momentarily forsaken
air. Elderly people used to look like that
during the War, when they had said good-bye to
someone and the train had left them alone on the
station platform. But the Colonel at once regained
his spryness: he turned to me to say what a pity it
was that the course was such a bad one for the
spectators. Then he got out his field-glasses and
lost consciousness of everything but the race.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The horses appeared to be galloping very
slowly when they came in sight for the last time.
I was standing up on the hill and couldn’t see them
distinctly. They had undoubtedly taken a long
time to get round the course. Three of them
jumped the last fence in a bunch, and Jerry was
one of the three. For years afterwards that last
fence was a recurrent subject of conversation in
the Colwood family, but there was always a good
deal of uncertainty about what actually happened.
Stephen admitted that it was ‘a bit of a mix-up.’
Anyhow, one of them fell, another one pecked
badly, and Jerry disengaged himself from the
group to scuttle up the short strip of meadow to
win by a length.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonel, of course, was the proudest man
in Sussex, and I myself could scarcely believe that
Stephen had really won. The only regrettable
element was provided by the dismal face of the
man who was second. This was a Mr. Green, a
lean and lanky gentleman farmer in a swallowtailed
scarlet coat—not a cheerful-looking man at
the best of times. He made no secret of the fact
that, in his opinion, Stephen had crossed him at
the last fence, but as he never got beyond looking
aggrieved about it no one really minded whether
Mr. Green had been interfered with or not, and
Jerry’s victory appeared to be an extremely
popular one. The Colonel was bombarded with
cordialities from all and sundry, and kept on exclaiming,
“I said I’d give the boy the horse if he
won and I’m dashed glad to do it!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen, who now emerged after weighing in,
wore an expression of dreamy enthusiasm and restricted
himself to a repetition of one remark,
which was, “By Gosh, the old horse jumped like a
stag;” now and again he supplemented this with
an assertion that he’d never had such a ride in his
life. He gazed at the old horse as if he never
wanted to look at anything else again, but the
Colonel very soon piloted him away to the port and
sandwiches. As they were going Stephen pulled
me by the arm with, “Come on, you queer old cuss;
you aren’t looking half as bright as you ought to
be.” As a matter of fact I was thinking what a
stagnant locality I lived in compared with this
sporting Elysium where everything seemed a
heyday of happiness and good fortune.</p>

<p class="pindent">When we had regaled ourselves with the
Colonel’s provisions, Stephen led me off into the
fields to watch the Farmers’ Race, which was
usually a very amusing show, he said. As we
strolled along by ourselves I told him how I’d
been mistaken for one of his brothers, and I asked
what had happened to his family that day. He
told me that both his brothers were abroad. Jack,
the elder one, had gone to India with his regiment
a month ago. The younger one was in the navy,
and was with the Mediterranean Fleet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re both of them as keen as mustard on the
chase. It’ll be pretty mouldy at the Rectory without
them when hunting starts again,” he remarked.</p>

<p class="pindent">I asked why his father wasn’t there to see him
ride. His face clouded. “The Guv’nor’ll be as
sick as muck at missing it. Poor old devil, he had
to take a ruddy funeral. Fancy choosing the day
of the point-to-points to be buried on!” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">It was after eight o’clock when I got home and
Aunt Evelyn was beginning to wonder what had
happened to me. I had enjoyed my day far more
than I could possibly have anticipated, but my
gentle and single-minded relative came in for nothing
but my moody and reticent afterthoughts and
I was rather ungracious to poor Miriam when she
urged me to have a second helping of asparagus.
Her face expressed mild consternation.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What, no more asparagus, sir? Why it’s the
first we’ve had this year!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="pindent">But I scowled at the asparagus as if it had done
me an injury. What was asparagus to me when
my head was full of the Colonel and his Cup, and
the exhilarating atmosphere of the Ringwell
Hunt? Why on earth had Aunt Evelyn chosen
such a rotten hole as Butley to live in? Anyhow,
Stephen had asked me to go and stay at Hoadley
Rectory for the Polesham Races next week, so
there was that to look forward to. And Aunt
Evelyn, who had relapsed into a tactful silence
(after trying me with the latest news from her beehives),
was probably fully aware that I was suffering
from the effects of an over-successful outing.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> summer was over and the green months
were discarded like garments for which I had
no further use. Twiddling a pink second-class
return ticket to London in my yellow-gloved
fingers (old Miriam certainly had washed them
jolly well) I stared through the carriage window
at the early October landscape and ruminated on
the opening meet in November. My excursions to
London were infrequent, but I had an important
reason for this one. I was going to try on my new
hunting clothes and my new hunting boots. I had
also got a seat for Kreisler’s concert in the afternoon,
but classical violin music was at present
crowded out of my mind by the more urgent business
of the day.</p>

<p class="pindent">I felt as though I had an awful lot to do before
lunch. Which had I better go to first, I wondered
(jerking the window up as the train screeched into
a tunnel), Craxwell or Kipward? To tell the
truth I was a bit nervous about both of them; for
when I had made my inaugural visits the individuals
who patrolled the interiors of those eminent
establishments had received me with such lofty condescension
that I had begun by feeling an intruder.
My clothes, I feared, had not quite the cut and
style that was expected of them by firms which had
the names of reigning sovereigns on their books,
and I was abashed by my ignorance of the specialized
articles which I was ordering. Equilibrium of
behaviour had perhaps been more difficult at the
bootmaker’s; so I decided to go to Kipward’s first.</p>

<p class="pindent">Emerging from Charing Cross I felt my personality
somehow diluted. At Baldock Wood Station
there had been no doubt that I was going up
to town in my best dark blue suit, and London had
been respectfully arranged at the other end of the
line. But in Trafalgar Square my gentlemanly
uniqueness had diminished to something almost
nonentitive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Had I been able to analyse my psychological
condition I could have traced this sensation to the
fact that my only obvious connections with the
metropolis were as follows: Mr. Pennett in Lincoln’s
Inn Fields (he was beginning to give me up
as a bad job) and the few shops where I owed
money for books and clothes. No one else in London
was aware of my existence. I felt half-inclined
to go into the National Gallery, but there
wasn’t enough time for that. I had been to the
British Museum once and the mere thought of it
now made me feel bored and exhausted. Yet I
vaguely knew that I ought to go to such places, in
the same way that I knew I ought to read <span class="it">Paradise
Lost</span> and <span class="it">The Pilgrim’s Progress</span>. But there
never seemed to be time for such edifications, and
the Kreisler concert was quite enough for one day.</p>

<p class="pindent">So I asserted my independence by taking a
hansom to the tailor’s, which was some distance
along Oxford Street. I wasn’t very keen on taxi-cabs,
though the streets were full of them now.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lower half of Kipward &amp; Son’s shop window
was fitted with a fine wire screening, on which
the crowns and vultures of several still undethroned
European Majesties were painted. In spite of
this hauteur the exterior now seemed quite companionable,
and I felt less of a nobody as I entered.
A person who might well have been Mr.
Kipward himself advanced to receive me; in his
eyes there was the bland half-disdainful interrogation
of a ducal butler; for the moment he still
seemed uncertain as to my credentials. On the
walls were some antlered heads and the whole
place seemed to know much more about sport than
I did. His suavely enunciated “what name?”
made the butler resemblance more apparent, but
with his “Ah, yes, Mr. Sherston, of course; your
coat and breeches are quite ready for you to try,
sir,” and the way he wafted me up a spacious flight
of stairs, he became an old-fashioned innkeeper who
had been in first-rate service, and there seemed
nothing in the world with which he was not prepared
to accommodate me. To have asked the
price of so much as a waistcoat would have been
an indecency. But I couldn’t help wondering, as I
was being ushered into one of the fitting compartments,
just how many guineas my black hunting-coat
was going to cost.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few minutes later I was sitting on a hard,
shiny saddle and being ciphered all over with a
lump of chalk. The sallow little man who fitted
my breeches remarked that the buff Bedford cord
which I had selected was ‘a very popular one.’ As
he put the finishing touch with his chalk he asked
me to stand up in the stirrups. Whereupon he
gazed upon his handiwork and found it good.
“Yes, that’s a beautiful seat,” he remarked
serenely. I wondered whether he would say the
same if he could see me landing over a post-and-rails
on Harkaway. The artist responsible for my
coat was a taciturn and deferential Scotchman,
stout, bald, and blond. He, too, seemed satisfied
that the garment would do him credit. My sole
regret was that I hadn’t yet been asked to wear the
Hunt button. Downstairs in the dignified and reposeful
reception room the presiding presence
was warming himself in front of a bright fire. As
he conducted me to the door I observed with secret
awe some racing colours in a glass case on the wall.
In after years I recognized them as being Lord
Rosebery’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Craxwell &amp; Co. was a less leisurely interior. As
might have been expected, there was an all-pervading
odour of leather, and one was made to
feel that only by a miracle could they finish up to
time the innumerable pairs of top-boots for which
they had received orders. The shop bristled and
shone with spurs; and whips and crops of all
varieties were stacked and slung and suspended
about the walls. Pace was indicated everywhere
and no one but a hard-bitten thruster could have
entered without humility. A prejudiced mind
might have imagined that all Craxwell’s customers
belong to some ultra-insolent, socially snobbish,
and libertine breed of military Mohocks. But the
percentage, I am sure, was quite a small one, and
my boots, though awkward to get into at first,
were close-fitting and high in the leg and altogether
calculated to make me feel that there were
very few fences I would not cram my horse at. In
outward appearance, at least, I was now a very
presentable fox-hunter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen Colwood had advised me to patronize
those particular places, and it was no fault of his
that I was still a comparative greenhorn. Anyhow,
young Mr. Craxwell (who looked quite as
much a gentleman as the self-satisfied sportsmen I
saw in his shop) was kind enough to tell me that I
had ‘a very good leg for a boot.’</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time I had put my bowler hat under my
seat in the grand circle at Queen’s Hall I was in a
state of unsporting excitement about Kreisler.
The name itself was suggestive of eminence, and
I was aware that he was a great violinist, though I
did not know that he would afterwards become the
most famous one in the world. I was also unconscious
that I was incapable of discriminating between
a good violinist and a second-rate one. My
capacity for admiration was automatic and unlimited,
and his photograph on the programme
made me feel that he must be a splendid man. I
was influenced, too, by the audience, which showed
its intensity of expectation by a subdued hub-bub
of talk which suddenly ceased altogether and was
swept away by the storm of clapping which
greeted the appearance of Kreisler.</p>

<p class="pindent">That he was an eminent violinist was obvious,
even to me, before he had played a single note of
the Handel Sonata with which the concert began.
There was something in the quiet and confident
little swing of his shoulders as he walked on to the
platform; something about the way he bowed with
his heels together; something about his erect and
dignified attitude while the accompanist flattened
the pages of the music on the piano; this ‘something’
impressed me very much. Then with a compact
and self-possessed nod he was ready, and his
lofty gaze was again on the audience.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the serenely opening bars of the accompaniment
both the bow and the violin were hanging
from his left hand, and the inevitable gesture with
which he raised the instrument to his chin seemed
to sustain the rhythm of my excitement which
reached its climax as I heard the first calm and eloquent
phrase. The evergreen loveliness of the
sonata unfolded itself, and Kreisler was interpreting
it with tenderness and majesty. For him the
concert was only one in that procession of recitals
which carried him along on his triumphant career.
But I knew then, as I had never known before,
that such music was more satisfying than the
huntsman’s horn. On my way home in the train
my thoughts were equally divided between the
Kreisler concert and my new hunting things.
Probably my new boots got the best of it.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting</span> by the schoolroom fire after tea on
the last Saturday in November, I cleaned my
almost new pipe (for I had taken to smoking,
though I hadn’t enjoyed it much so far) with a
white pigeon’s feather from the lawn.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had got home early after a rotten half-day
with the Dumborough. I’d had four days with
them since the opening meet, and it was no use
pretending that I’d enjoyed myself. Apart from
the pleasure of wearing my self-consciously new
clothes I had returned home each day feeling dissatisfied.
It wasn’t so much that the Hunt seemed
to spend most of its time pottering round impenetrable
woodlands as that the other subscribers
appeared to be unwilling to acknowledge my
existence except by staring me into a state of acute
awareness of my ignorance of what was being done
and how to do it. There was also the problem of
Harkaway, who demonstrated more clearly every
time I took him out that his stamina was insufficient
for a hard day’s hunting. It was only his
courage which kept him going at all; in spite of
Dixon’s efforts in the stable the old horse was
already, as he ruefully remarked, looking ‘properly
tucked-up,’ and the long distances to the meets
were an additional hardship for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I lit my pipe I felt that I ought to be blissfully
reconstructing the day’s sport. But there
seemed to be no blissful details to reconstruct. The
hounds had run fairly well for about half an hour,
but very little of it had been in the open. And I
had been so busy hanging on to my excitable horse
that I had only a hazy recollection of what had
happened, except that Bill Jaggett had damned
my eyes for following him too closely over the only
jumpable place in a fence. Bill Jaggett was, to
my mind, one of the horrors of the Hunt. He was
a hulking, coarse-featured, would-be thruster;
newly rich, ill-conditioned, and foul-mouthed.
“Keep that bloody horse well out of my way,”
was a specimen of his usual method of verbal intercourse
in the hunting-field. What with the vulgarly
horsey cut and colour of his clothes and the
bumptious and bullying manners which matched
them, he was no ornament to the Dumborough
Hunt; to me he was a positive incubus, for he typified
everything that had alarmed and repelled me
in my brief experience of fox-hunting. Except
for the violent impression he made on my mind I
should have said nothing about him; but even now
I cannot remember his behaviour without astonishment.
He was without exception the clumsiest
and most mutton-fisted horseman I have ever
observed. No horse ever went well for him, and
when he wasn’t bellowing at his groom he was
cursing and cropping the frothing five-year-old
which was carrying his fifteen-stone carcass. (He
usually rode young horses, since he flattered himself
that he was ‘making’ them to sell at a profit;
but as he was short-sighted he frequently fell on
his head and gave me the satisfaction of watching
him emerge from a ditch, mud-stained and imprecating.)
He took no interest in anything except
horses and hunting, and it was difficult to believe
that he had ever learnt to read or write.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was one of a small contingent who fancied
themselves as hard riders. Owing to the character
of the country they always had to be looking for
something to jump, whether the hounds were running
or not, and they were often in trouble with
Lord Dumborough for ‘larking’ over unnecessary
fences. In this they were conspicuous, for the
other followers of the Hunt were a pusillanimous
lot of riders, and there was always a queue of them
at the gaps, over which they bobbed and bounced
like a flock of sheep. Musing on my disappointing
experiences, I decided that next week I would
go and have a day with the Potford Hounds who
were no further off than the Dumborough. They
were said to be short of foxes, but Dixon had heard
that their new Master had been showing good
sport.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Elaborate arrangements had to be made for my
day with the Potford. The distance to the meet
was nearly fourteen miles, and Dixon decided that
the best plan was for him to ride Harkaway over
the night before. This outing was very much to
his taste, and it was easy to imagine him clattering
importantly into the yard at the Bull Inn with
Harkaway’s rug rolled on the saddle in front of
him, and doing everything that was humanly possible
to make the old horse comfortable in the
strange stable. It is equally certain that, over his
glass of beer in the evening, he would leave no
doubt in the minds of the gossips in the bar-parlour
that his young gentleman was a very dashing
and high-class sportsman. All this he would
do with the sobriety and reticence of an old family
servant; before going to bed he would take a last
look at Harkaway to see whether he had finished
up his feed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Driving myself to the meet in the soft, cloudy
morning, I enjoyed feeling like Mr. Sponge on his
way to look at a strange pack. The only difference
was that Sponge was a bold and accomplished
rider and I was still an experimental one.</p>

<p class="pindent">But my appearance, I hoped, would do Dixon
no discredit, and on the seat beside me was my
newest acquisition, a short leather hunting-crop
with a very long lash to it. The length of the lash,
though extremely correct, was an embarrassment.
The crop had only arrived the previous day, and I
had taken it out on the lawn and attempted to
crack it. But I was unable to create the echoing
reports which hunt-servants seemed to produce so
effortlessly, and my feeble snappings ended with a
painful flick on my own neck. So I resolved to
watch very carefully and see exactly how they did
it. Big swells like Bill Jaggett never lost an opportunity
of cracking their whips when they
caught sight of a stray hound. I couldn’t imagine
myself daring to do that or shout ‘Get-along-forrid’
in such tremendous tones; but it would be
nice to feel that I could make the welkin ring with
my new crop if I wanted to. I had yet to learn
that the quiet and unobtrusive rider is better liked
by a huntsman and his assistants than the noisy
and officious one.</p>

<p class="pindent">I wondered whether I should know any of the
people out with the Potford, and wished I had
made a better job of tying my white stock that
morning. Tying a stock was very difficult, especially
as I didn’t know how to do it. Mr. Gaffikin’s
was wonderful, and I wished I knew him
well enough to ask him how the effect was produced.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was keen to see what the new Master of the
Potford was like. Dixon had heard quite a lot
about him. His name was Guy Warder, and he was
a middle-aged man who hunted the hounds himself
and did everything as cheaply as possible. He
bought the most awful old screws for next to nothing
at Tattersalls, made his stablemen ride them
all the way down from London to save the expense
of a horse-box, and brought them out hunting
next day. It seemed that the Hunt was already
divided into factions for and against him, and it
was doubtful whether he would be allowed to hunt
the country another season. It was said that he was
a bad rider and always held on to the pommel of
his saddle when jumping his fences. It was also
rumoured that he sometimes got very drunk.
People complained that he was slow, and often
drew the coverts on foot. But he was popular with
the farmers, and had been killing an abnormal
number of foxes.</p>

<p class="pindent">There he was, anyhow, sitting low down in the
saddle among his hounds on a patch of grass in
front of the Bull Inn. He was a dumpy little man
with a surly red face, and he wore a coat that had
once been scarlet and was now plum-coloured. He
was on a good-looking horse, but the whips were
mounted on under-bred and raw-boned animals
which might well have been sent to the kennels
for the hounds to eat. The hounds were dull
coated and hungry looking. Evidently Mr. Guy
Warder cared nothing for smartness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon saw me into the saddle with a quietly
satisfied air and I rode out of the stable-yard. The
first person I recognized was Bill Jaggett, who
was hoisting himself on to the back of a slim, skittish,
and startled-looking roan mare. He greeted
me with a scowl and then remarked with a grunt,
“You’ve brought your old skin over here, have
you? Don’t give him much rest, do you?” The
sneer in his voice made me hate him more than
ever, but I was too diffident and confused to reply.</p>

<p class="pindent">With him was his boon companion, Roger Pomfret,
a ginger-haired, good-for-nothing nephew of
Lord Dumborough who blundered about the
country on a piebald cob and vied with Jaggett
in coarseness of language and general uncouthness.
But Pomfret, who was impecunious and
spent his spare time in dubious transactions connected
with the Turf, had a touch of bumpkin
geniality about him, and was an amiable and
polished gentleman when closely compared with
his unprepossessing associate, who, at that moment
was adjuring him (with the usual epithets) not to
knock the guts out of that horse or he’d never lend
him another (at the same time jogging his own
mare unmercifully in the mouth and kicking her
with one of his long spurs). “<span class="it">Will</span> you stand still,
you—” but before the last word was out of his
mouth the huntsman had shaken up his hounds
with a defiant little toot of the horn and was trotting
down the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">“The old rat-catcher doesn’t allow much law,
does he? It’s only six minutes past eleven now!”
remarked Pomfret, consulting his ticker with an
oafish grin.</p>

<p class="pindent">I dropped behind them, and was at once joined
by Mr. Gaffikin, effusively cheerful, elbows well
out, and a bunch of violets in his buttonhole. His
friendliness revived my spirits, and he seemed to
regard Jaggett and Pomfret as an excellent joke.
“It’s as good as a play when they start slanging
one another,” he said, eyeing their clumsy backs as
they tit-tupped along.</p>

<p class="pindent">He then told me, in an undertone, to keep pretty
wideawake to-day, as he’d heard that old Warder’d
got something up his sleeve. He winked expressively.
“I hear they’ve had one or two <span class="it">very queer</span>
foxes lately,” he added. I wasn’t sure what he
meant, but I nodded sagaciously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing exciting happened, however, at the first
covert. In accordance with his usual habit, the
huntsman got off his horse and plunged into the
undergrowth on foot.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They say the old boy’s got a better nose than
any of his hounds,” someone remarked.</p>

<p class="pindent">In spite of my anxiety to avoid him, I found myself
standing close behind Jaggett, who was bragging
about a wonderful day he’d had ‘up at Melton’
the week before. But I was feeling more at my
ease now, and I was expressing this by swinging
the lash of my crop lightly to and fro. The result
was appalling. Somehow the end of it arrived at
the rump of Jaggett’s roan mare; with nervous
adroitness she tucked in her tail with my lash under
it. She then began kicking, and in my efforts to
dislodge the lash I found myself ‘playing’ Jaggett
and his horse like a huge fish. The language which
followed may be imagined, and I was flabbergasted
with confusion at my clumsiness. When I had extricated
my thong and the uproar had subsided to
a series of muttered imprecations, I retreated.</p>

<p class="pindent">To my surprise Mr. Gaffikin came up and congratulated
me admirably on the way I had ‘pulled
Bill Jaggett’s leg.’ He said it was the neatest
thing he’d ever seen and he wouldn’t have missed it
for worlds. He slapped his leg in a paroxysm of
amusement, and I modestly accepted the implication
that I had done it on purpose. Guy Warder
then emerged from his investigations of the undergrowth
and blew his hounds out of covert.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where are you going now, Master?” shouted a
sharp-faced man with a green collar on his cut-away
coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ll find out when I get there,” growled
Warder, hunching his shoulders and trotting
briskly down the lane.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Gaffikin explained that the green-collared
man was a notoriously tardy and niggardly subscriber.
Nevertheless, we were apparently making
an unexpected excursion, and people were audibly
wondering what the old beggar was up to now.
Anyhow, I gathered that we were heading for the
best bit of the vale country, though it had been expected
that we would draw some big woods in the
other direction. After a couple of miles he turned
in at a gate and made for a small spinney. Word
now came back from the first whip that ‘an old dog-fox
had been viewed there this morning.’ Halfway
across the field to the spinney the Master
pulled up, faced round, and exclaimed gruffly, “I’d
be obliged if you’d keep close together on this side
of the covert, gentlemen.” He then cantered off
with his hounds and disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stick close to me,” said Mr. Gaffikin in a low
voice. “The old devil’s got a drag laid, as sure as
mutton!”</p>

<p class="pindent">He was right. A minute afterward there was a
shrill halloa; when we got round to the far side of
the spinney there was the huntsman going hell for
leather down the slope with his hounds running
mute on one side of him. With my heart in my
mouth I followed Mr. Gaffikin over one fence after
another. Harkaway was a bold jumper and he
took complete control of me. I can remember very
little of what happened, but I was told afterwards
that we went about four miles across the only good
bit of vale in the Potford country. The gallop
ended with the huntsman blowing his horn under
a park wall while the hounds scrabbled and bayed
rather dubiously over a rabbit-hole. There were
only eight or ten riders up at the finish, and the
credit of my being among them belonged to Harkaway.
Jaggett, thank heaven, was nowhere to be
seen.</p>

<p class="pindent">Warder took off his cap and mopped his brow.
Then he looked with grudging good humour at the
remnant of his field and their heaving horses.
“Now let the bastards say I don’t go well enough!”
he remarked, as he slipped his horn back in its case
on his saddle.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">M</span>y</span> successful scramble across the Potford
Vale obliterated all the dreariness and disappointment
of my days with the Dumborough. My
faith in fox-hunting had been reinforced in the nick
of time, and I joggled home feeling a hero. Highly
strung old Harkaway seemed to share my elation.
His constitution was equal to a fast hunt, but he
needed to be taken home early in the afternoon.
The long dragging days in the Dumborough woodlands
wore him out. Even now he had a dozen
miles to go to his stable, but they seemed short ones
to me for I was thinking all the way how pleased
Dixon would be. For the first time in my career
as an independent sportsman I had a big story to
tell him.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the light of my mature experience I should
say that I had very little to tell Dixon, unless I had
told him the truth. The truth (which I couldn’t
have admitted even to my inmost self) was that
my performance had consisted not so much in riding
to hounds as in acting as a hindrance to Harkaway’s
freedom of movement while he followed Mr.
Gaffikin’s mare over several miles of closely fenced
country—almost pulling my arms out of their sockets
in the process. Had I told the truth I’d have
said that during that gallop I was flustered, uncomfortable,
and out of breath; that at every fence
we jumped I was all over the saddle; and that, for
all I had known, there might have been no hounds
at all, since they were always a couple of fields
ahead of us, and we were, most of us, merely following
the Master, who already knew exactly which
way they would go.</p>

<p class="pindent">I lay stress on these facts because it is my firm
belief that the majority of fox-hunting riders never
enjoy a really ‘quick thing’ while it is in progress.
Their enjoyment therefore, mainly consists in
talking about it afterwards and congratulating
themselves on their rashness or their discretion, according
to their temperaments. One man remembers
how he followed the first whip over an
awkward stile, while another thinks how cleverly he
made use of a lucky lane or a line of gates. Neither
of them was able to watch the hounds while they
were running. And so it was with me. Had I been
alone I should have lost the hounds within three
fields of the covert where they started.</p>

<p class="pindent">But my complacency had been unperturbed by
any such self-scrutinies when I clattered into the
stable-yard in the twilight, just as Dixon emerged
from the barn with a sieve of oats and a stable-lantern.
His quick eyes were all over the horse before
I was out of the saddle.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Going a bit short in front, isn’t he?” was his
first remark.</p>

<p class="pindent">I agreed that he <span class="it">was</span> going a bit queer. Dixon
had seen in a moment what I had failed to notice in
twelve miles. My feeling of importance diminished.
I followed the two of them into the loose-box.
Dixon’s lantern at once discovered an over-reach
on the heel of one of Harkaway’s front feet.
No reference was made to my having failed to notice
it; and as we said, it was a clean cut, which was
much better than a bruise. When asked whether
it had been a good day, I replied “Topping,” but
Dixon seemed in no hurry to hear about it, and he
went out to get the gruel. I stood silent while the
old horse drank it eagerly—Dixon remarking with
satisfaction that he’d “suck the bottom out of the
bucket if he wasn’t careful.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Unable to restrain myself any longer, I blurted
out my news: “They ran slap across the vale for
about twenty-five minutes; a five-mile point without
a check. It must have been seven or eight miles
as they ran!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon, who was already busy brushing the dried
mud off Harkaway’s legs, straightened himself
with a whistle. “Did you see it all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The whole way; there were only ten up at the
finish.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Did they kill him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, he got into a rabbit-hole just outside Cranfield
Park. The Master said it was no good trying
to get him out as it was such a big place.” Dixon
looked puzzled.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s funny,” he remarked. “They told me at
the ‘Bull’ last night that he’s a great one for terriers
and digging out foxes. A lot of the subscribers
complain about it. They say he’s never
happy unless he’s got his head down a rabbit-hole!”</p>

<p class="pindent">With a knowing air I told him that Mr. Gaffikin
had said it was a drag.</p>

<p class="pindent">“By Jingo! If it was a drag they must have
gone like blazes!” I asserted that they <span class="it">did</span> go like
blazes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You must have jumped some big places.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a note of surprise in his voice which
made me feel that I had been doing more than was
expected of me. Could it be possible, I wondered,
that Dixon was actually proud of his pupil? And,
indeed, there must have been a note of jubilation
in his voice when, as he bent down to brush the mud
off Harkaway’s hocks, he asked; “Did Mr. Gaffikin
see him jumping?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. I foll—I was close to him all the way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps it was just as well that Harkaway,
munching away at his feed, was unable to lift his
long-suffering face and say what <span class="it">he</span> thought about
my horsemanship! Looking back at that half-lit
stable from the detachment of to-day, I can almost
believe that, after I had gone indoors to my boiled
eggs, Dixon and the old horse had a confidential
chat, like the old friends that they were. Anyhow,
the horse and his groom understood one another
quite as well as the groom understood his master.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn did her best to come up to the
scratch while I was talking big at the dinner-table.
But the wonderful performances of Harkaway and
myself during our exciting half-hour in the Potford
Vale were beyond her powers of response, and her
well-meant but inadequate interjections caused my
narrative to lose a lot of its sporting significance.
Anxiety for my safety overshadowed her enthusiasm,
and when I was telling her how we jumped a
brook (it was only a flooded ditch, really), she uttered
an ill-timed warning against getting wet
when I was hot, which nearly caused my narrative
to dry up altogether.</p>

<p class="pindent">Faithful Miriam made things no better by exclaiming,
as she handed me a plate with two banana
fritters on it, “You’ll break your neck, sir, if you
go out with them hounds much oftener!”</p>

<p class="pindent">What was the good of trying to make them understand
about a hunt like that, I thought, as I
blundered up the dark stairs to the schoolroom to
dash off a highly coloured account of my day for
Stephen Colwood. He, at any rate, was an audience
after my own heart, and the only one I had, except
Dixon, whose appreciation of my exploits was less
fanciful and high-flown. Writing to Stephen I
was at once away in a world of make-believe; and
the letter, no doubt, was a good example of what
he used to call my ‘well-known sprightly insouciance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Poor Stephen was living in lodgings in London,
and could only get home for a hunt on Saturdays.
A wealthy neighbour had promised Parson Colwood
an opening for his son if he could qualify as
a chartered accountant, and this nauseating task
occupied him five days a week. So my visualization
of Stephen, exiled in a foggy street in Pimlico,
made it doubly easy for me to scribble my lively account
of a day which now seemed so delightfully
adventurous.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen’s reply was a telegram asking me to stay
at the Rectory for as long as I liked, and this was
followed by a letter in which he announced that he’d
got a month’s holiday. “If your old nag’s still lame
I can get you some top-hole hirelings from Downfield
for thirty-five bob a day, and I’ve ordered the
Guv’nor to offer up prayers next Sunday forbidding
the Almighty to send any frost to Sussex.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn considered this almost blasphemous;
but she thought my visit to Hoadley Rectory
an excellent idea, for Stephen was quite one of her
favourites, and of the Rev. Colwood (whom she had
met at a diocesan garden party) she had the highest
possible opinion. “Such a fine face! And Mrs.
Colwood seemed a real fellow creature—quite one
of one’s own sort,” she exclaimed, adding, “D’you
mind holding his hind-legs, dear?” for she was preoccupied
at the moment in combing the matted hair
out of one of her Persian cats.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>topping</span> at every station, a local train conveyed
me sedately into Sussex. Local and sedate,
likewise, were the workings of my brain, as I
sat in an empty compartment with the <span class="it">Southern
Daily News</span> on my knees. I had bought that unpretentious
paper in order to read about the Ringwell
Hounds, whose doings were regularly reported
therein. And sure enough the previous day’s sport
was described in detail, and “Among the large field
out” was the name, with many others, of “Mr. Colwood,
junr.” Although I had yet to become acquainted
with the parishes through which Reynard
had made his way, I read with serious attention how
he had “crossed the Downfield and Boffham road,
borne right-handed into Hooksworth Wood, turned
sharply back, and worked his way over the country
to Icklesfield,” etc., etc., until “hounds ran into him
after a woodland hunt of nearly three hours.” The
account ended with the following word: “If
ever hounds deserved blood they did this time, as
they had to work out nearly every yard of their
fox’s line.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Having read this through twice I allowed my
thoughts to dally with the delightful prospect of
my being a participator in similar proceedings next
day. Occasionally I glanced affectionately at the
bulging kit-bag containing those masterpieces by
Craxwell and Kipward which had cost me more
than one anxious journey to London. Would
Stephen approve of my boots, I wondered, staring
out of the window at the reflective monochrome of
flooded meadows and the brown gloom of woodlands
in the lowering dusk of a heavily clouded
December afternoon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whatever he might think of my boots, there was
no doubt that he approved of my arrival when the
fussy little train stopped for the last time and I
found him waiting for me on the platform. I allowed
him to lug my bag out of the station, and
soon he had got it stowed away in the old yellow-wheeled
buggy, had flicked his father’s favourite
hunter into a trot (“a nailing good jumper, but as
slow as a hearse”), and was telling me all about the
clinking hunt they’d had the day before, and how
he’d enjoyed my account of the Potford gallop.
“You’ve got a regular gift for writing, you funny
old cock! You might make a mint of money if you
wrote for <span class="it">Horse and Hound</span> or <span class="it">The Field</span>!” he exclaimed,
and we agreed that I couldn’t write worse
than the man in the <span class="it">Southern Daily</span>, whose “Reynard
then worked his way across the country” etc.
afterwards became one of our stock jokes.</p>

<p class="pindent">In describing my friendship with Stephen I am
faced by a difficulty which usually arises when
one attempts to reproduce the conversational oddities
of people who are on easy terms. We adopted
and matured a specialized jargon drawn almost exclusively
from characters in the novels of Surtees;
since we knew these almost by heart, they provided
us with something like a dialect of our own, and in
our care-free moments we exchanged remarks in
the mid-Victorian language of such character-parts
as Mr. Romford, Major Yammerton, and Sir
Moses Mainchance, while Mr. Jorrocks was an all-pervading
influence. In our Surtees obsession we
went so far that we almost identified ourselves with
certain characters on appropriate occasions. One
favourite rôle which Stephen facetiously imposed
on me was that of a young gentleman named Billy
Pringle who, in the novel which he adorns, is reputed
to be very rich. My £600 a year was thus
magnified to an imaginary £10,000, and he never
wearied of referring to me as ‘the richest commoner
in England.’ The stress was laid on my
great wealth and we never troubled to remember
that the Mr. Pringle of the novel was a dandified
muff and ‘only half a gentleman.’ I cannot remember
that I ever succeeded in finding a consistent
rôle for Stephen, but I took the Surtees game
for granted from the beginning, and our adaptation
of the Ringwell Hunt to the world created by that
observant novelist was simplified by the fact that
a large proportion of the Ringwell subscribers
might have stepped straight out of his pages. To
their idiosyncrasies I shall return in due course: in
the meantime I am still on my way to Hoadley
Rectory, and Stephen is pointing out such fox-hunting
features of the landscape as are observable
from the high road while we sway companionably
along in the old-fashioned vehicle.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s Basset Wood—one of our werry best
Wednesday coverts,” he remarked, indicating with
the carriage-whip a dark belt of trees a couple of
miles away under the level cloud-bars of a sallow
sunset. He eyed the dimly undulating pastures
which intervened, riding over them in his mind’s eye
as he had so often ridden over them in reality.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’ll be there on Monday,” he went on, his
long, serious face lighting up as his gaze returned
to the road before him. “Yes, we’ll be drawing
there on Monday,” he chuckled, “and if we can but
find a straight-necked old dog-fox, then I’ll be the
death of a fi’-pun’-note—dash my wig if I won’t!”</p>

<p class="pindent">I said that it looked quite a nice bit of country
and asked whether they often ran this way.
Stephen became less cheerful as he informed me
that there was precious little reason for them to run
this way.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s not a strand of wire till you get to the
road,” he exclaimed, “but over there”—(pointing
to the left) “there’s a double-distilled blighter who’s
wired up all his fences. And what’s more, his
keeper shoots every fox who shows his nose in the
coverts. And will you believe me when I tell you,
George my lad, that the man who owns those coverts
is the same ugly mugged old sweep who persuaded
the Guv’nor to get me trained as a chartered
accountant! And how much longer I’m going to
stick it I don’t know! Seven months I’ve been
worriting my guts out in London, and all on the
off-chance of getting a seat in the office of that sanctimonious
old vulpicide.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I consoled him with a reminder that he’d spent
most of August and September shooting and fishing
in Scotland. (His father rented a place in
Skye every summer.) And during the remainder
of the drive we debated the deeply desirable and not
impossible eventuality of Stephen’s escape from
chartered accountancy. His one idea was to ‘get
into the Army by the back door.’ If only he could
get into the Gunners he’d be happy. His elder
brother Jack was in the Gunners, and was expecting
to be moved from India to Ireland. And Ireland,
apparently, was a fox-hunting Elysium.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I really must have a chat with Colonel Hesmon
about it. By the way, the dear old boy’s asked us
both to lunch to-morrow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">This led to a rhapsody about that absolutely top-hole
performer Jerry, who had been given him by
the Colonel after he’d won the Heavy-Weight
Race. My Harkaway, on the other hand, was
more a subject for solicitude, and I reluctantly confessed
that he didn’t seem up to my weight. It was
a thousand pities, said Stephen, that I couldn’t
have bought that six-year-old of young Lewison’s.
“Given him for his twenty-first birthday by his
uncle, who’d forked out £170 for him. But young
Lewison couldn’t ride a hair of the horse, though he
was a nailing fine ‘lepper’ and a rare good sort to
look at. They sent him up to Tatts last week and
he went for £90, according to the paper. Gosh,
what a bit of luck for the cove who got him so
cheap!”</p>

<p class="pindent">My appetite for horseflesh was stimulated by this
anecdote, but I wondered what Mr. Pennett would
say if I wrote and told him that I’d bought another
ninety pounds’ worth! For Mr. Pennett still refused
to allow me more than £450 of my £600.
The balance, he said, must be ‘invested for a rainy
day.’</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen’s visionary contemplations of ‘being
stationed at the Curragh and riding at Punchestown
Races’ were interrupted by our arrival at the
Rectory. I had stayed there more than once in the
summer, so I received a surly but not unfriendly
salute from Abel, the grim little old groom with
iron-grey whiskers who led our conveyance soberly
away to the stable-yard. This groom was an
old-fashioned coachman, and he had never been
heard to utter a sentence of more than six words.
His usual reply, when asked about the health of one
of the horses, was either, “Well enough” or “Not
over-bright.” Stephen now reminded him (quite
unnecessarily, and probably not for the first time)
that two of the horses would be going out hunting
on Monday. Abel grunted, “Got ’em both shod
this afternoon,” and disappeared round the corner
of the shrubbery with the buggy.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was only one thing against him, said
Stephen, and that was that he hadn’t a ghost of an
idea how to trim their tails, which were always an
absolute disgrace. “I’ve told him again and again
to <span class="it">pull</span> the hair out,” he remarked, “but he goes on
just the same, cutting them with scissors, and the
result is that they come out at the opening meet
with tails like chrysanthemums!”</p>

<p class="pindent">From this it may be inferred that there were
many things in the Rectory stable which fell short
of Stephen’s ideal. He and his brothers were always
trying to bring ‘the old guv’nor’ into line with
what they believed to be the Melton Mowbray
standard of smartness. There was also the question
of persuading him to buy a motor-car. But Parson
Colwood was a Sussex man by birth and he valued
his native provincialism more than the distant
splendours of the Shires toward which his offspring
turned their unsophisticated eyes. The Rectory, as
I knew it then, had the charm of something untouched
by modernity.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Rev. Harry Colwood, as I remember him,
was a composite portrait of Charles Kingsley and
Matthew Arnold. This fanciful resemblance has
no connection with literature, toward which Mr.
Colwood’s disposition was respectful but tepid. My
mental semi-association of him with Arnold is probably
due to the fact that he had been in the Rugby
eleven somewhere in the ’sixties. And I have, indeed,
heard him speak of Arnold’s poem, <span class="it">Rugby
Chapel</span>. But the Kingsley affinity was more clearly
recognizable. Like Kingsley, Mr. Colwood loved
riding, shooting, and fishing, and believed that such
sports were congruous with the Christian creed
which he unobtrusively accepted and lived up to.
It is questionable, however, whether he would have
agreed with Kingsley’s Christian Socialism. One
of his maxims was “Don’t marry for money but
marry where money is,” and he had carried this
into effect by marrying, when he was over forty, a
sensible Scotch lady with a fortune of £1,500 a
year, thereby enabling his three sons to be brought
up as keen fox-hunters, game-shooters, and salmon-fishers.
And however strongly the Author of his
religion might have condemned these sports, no one
could deny him the Christian adjectives gentle, patient,
and just.</p>

<p class="pindent">At first I had been intimidated by him, for the
scrutinizing look that he gave me was both earnest
and stern. His were eyes which looked straight at
the world from under level brows, and there was
strictness in the lines of his mouth. But the kindliness
of his nature emerged in the tone of his
voice, which was pitched moderately low. In his
voice a desire for gaiety seemed to be striving to
overmaster an inherent sadness. This undertone
of sadness may have been accentuated as the result
of his ripened understanding of a world which was
not all skylarking and sport, but Stephen (who
was a lankier and less regular-featured edition of
his father) had inherited the same quality of voice.
Mr. Colwood was a naturally nervous man with
strong emotions, which he rigidly repressed at all
times.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I arrived that afternoon both the Rector
and his wife were attending some parochial function
in the village. So Stephen took me up to the
schoolroom, where we had our tea and he jawed
to me about horses and hunting to his heart’s content.
He ended by asserting that he’d ‘sooner
cheer a pack of Pomeranians after a weasel from
a bath-chair than waste his life making money in a
blinking office.’</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span> tenor</span> bell in Hoadley Church tower was
making its ultimate appeal to those who were
still on their way to morning service. While
Stephen and I hurried hatless across the sloping
cricket-field which divided the Rectory garden from
the churchyard I sniffed the quiet wintry-smelling
air and wondered how long Mr. Colwood’s sermon
would last. I had never been to his church before;
there was a suggestion of embarrassment in the idea
of seeing him in a long white surplice—almost as if
one were taking an unfair advantage of him. Also,
since I hadn’t been to church with Aunt Evelyn
for Heaven knew how long, I felt a bit of an outsider
as I followed Stephen up the aisle to the Rectory
pew where his matronly mother was awaiting
us with the solemnly cheerful face of one who never
mumbled the responses but made them as though
she meant every word. Stephen, too, had the serene
sobriety of an habitual public-worshipper. No
likelihood of his standing up at one of those awkward
places when everyone kneels down when you
don’t expect them to.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the service proceeded I glanced furtively
around me at the prudent Sunday-like faces of the
congregation. I thought of the world outside, and
the comparison made life out there seem queer and
unreal. I felt as if we were all on our way to next
week in a ship. But who was I, and what on earth
had I been doing? My very name suddenly seemed
as though it scarcely belonged to me. Stephen was
sitting there beside me, anyhow; there was no doubt
about his identity, and I thought what a nice face
he had, gentle and humorous and alight with natural
intelligence. I looked from him to his father,
who had been in the background, so far, since the
curate had been reading the service (in an unemphatic
businesslike voice). But the Rector’s eye
met mine, which shied guiltily away, and my wool-gathering
was interrupted. Even so might his gaze
have alighted on one of the coughing village children
at the back of the church.</p>

<p class="pindent">My sense of unfamiliarity with what was going
on was renewed when Colonel Hesmon’s wizened
face and bushy grey eyebrows appeared above the
shiny brass eagle to read the First Lesson. This
was not quite the same Colonel who had been in
such a frenzy of excitement over the point-to-point
race eight months ago, when he had exclaimed, over
and over again, “I’ve told the boy that if he wins
<span class="it">I’ll give him the horse</span>!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonel’s voice was on church parade now,
and he was every inch a churchwarden as well. He
went through the lesson with dispassionate distinctness
and extreme rapidity. Since it was a long
passage from Isaiah, he went, as he would have
said, “a rattling good gallop.” But the words, I
thought, were incongruous ones when uttered by
the Colonel. “And he will lift up an ensign to the
nations from far, and will hiss unto them from the
end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with
speed swiftly: none shall be weary nor stumble
among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither
shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the
latchet of their shoes be broken: whose arrows are
sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’ hoofs
shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
whirlwind; their roaring shall be like a lion, they
shall roar like young lions: yea, they shall roar, and
lay hold of the prey, and shall carry it away safe,
and none shall deliver it. And in that day they
shall war against them like the roaring of the sea:
and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens
thereof. Here endeth the First Lesson.” And the
brisk little man turned over the leaves to a passage
from Peter, arranged the gold-embroidered marker,
and returned to his pew with erect and decorous
demeanour.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twenty minutes later Mr. Colwood climbed the
pulpit steps to the strains of ‘O God our help in
ages past.’ My own vocal contribution was inconspicuous,
but I had a stealthy look at my watch,
which caused Stephen, who was giving a creditable
performance of the hymn, to nudge me with his
elbow. The sermon lasted a laborious twelve minutes.
The Rector had a nervous mannerism which
consisted in his continually gathering up his surplice
with his left hand, as if he were testing the
quality of the linen with his fingers. The offertory
was for a missionary society, and he took as his
text: “<span class="it">He that hath two coats, let him impart to
him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him
do likewise.</span>” The results of the collection were
handed to him on a wooden plate by the Colonel,
who remarked afterwards at lunch that he “didn’t
mind saying that with the best will in the world he’d
have preferred to give his half-sovereign to someone
nearer home”—Stephen having already made
his rather obvious joke—“Whatever the Guv’nor
may say in his sermon about ‘imparting,’ if I ever
get a new hunting-coat I’m going to ruddy well
keep my old one for wet days!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun was shining when we emerged from the
musty smelling interior. The Colonel, with his
nattily rolled umbrella, perfectly brushed bowler
hat, and nervously blinking eyes, paid his respects
to Mrs. Colwood with punctilious affability; then
he shepherded Stephen and myself away to have a
look round his stables before lunch. We were there
in less than five minutes, the Colonel chatting so
gaily all the way that I could scarcely have got a
word in edgeways even if I had felt sufficient confidence
in myself to try.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonel had been a widower for many years,
and like most lonely living people he easily became
talkative. Everything in his establishment was
arranged and conducted with elaborate nicety and
routine, and he took an intense pride in his stable,
which contained half a dozen hunters who stood
in well-aired and roomy loose-boxes, surrounded
by every luxury which the Colonel’s care could
contrive: the name of each horse was on a tablet
suspended above the manger. Elegant green stable-buckets
(with the Colonel’s numerous initials
painted on them in white) were arranged at regular
intervals along the walls, and the harness-room was
hung with enough bits and bridles to stock a saddler’s
shop. It was, as Stephen pointed out to me
afterwards, “a regular museum of mouth-gear.”
For the Colonel was one of those fussy riders with
indifferent hands who are always trying their
horses with a new bit.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I haven’t found the key to this mare’s mouth
yet,” he would say, as the irritated animal shook its
head and showered everyone within range with
flecks of froth. And when he got home from hunting
he would say to his confidential old head-groom:
“I think this mare’s still a bit under-bitted,
Dumbrell,” and they would debate over half the
bits in the harness-room before he rode the mare
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sunday morning stables’ being one of his favourite
ceremonies, the Colonel now led us from one
loose-box to another, commenting affectionately on
each inmate, and stimulated by the fact that one
of his audience was a stranger. Each of them, apparently,
was a compendium of unique equine qualities,
on which I gazed with unaffected admiration,
while Stephen chimed in with “Never seen the old
chestnut look so fit, Colonel,” or “Looking an absolute
picture,” while Dumbrell was deferentially
at hand all the time to share the encomiums offered
to his charges. The Colonel, of course, had a stock
repertory of remarks about each one of them, including
how they had won a certain point-to-point
or (more frequently) why they hadn’t. The last
one we looked at was a big well-bred brown horse
who stood very much ‘over at the knees.’ The Colonel
had hunted him twelve seasons and he had an
equivalently long rigmarole to recite about him, beginning
with “I remember Sam Hames saying to
me—(I bought him off old Hames of Leicester,
you know)—that horse is the most natural jumper
I’ve ever had in my stable. And he was right, for
the old horse has only given me one bad toss in
twelve years, and that was no fault of his own, for
he landed on the stump of a willow tree; it was at
that rough fence just outside Clout’s Wood—nasty
place, too—you remember I showed it you the other
day, Steve;” all of which Stephen had probably
heard fifty times before, and had been shown the
‘nasty place’ half a dozen times into the bargain.
It was only when he heard the distant booming of
the luncheon-gong that the Colonel was able to tear
himself away from the brown horse’s loose-box.</p>

<p class="pindent">While going into the house we passed through
what he called ‘the cleaning room,’ which was a
sort of wide corridor with a skylight to it. Along
the wall stood an astonishing array of hunting-boots.
These struck me as being so numerous that
I had the presence of mind to count them. There
were twenty-seven pairs. Now a good pair of top-boots,
if properly looked after and repaired, will
last the owner a good many years; and a new pair
once in three years might be considered a liberal allowance
for a man who has started with two or three
pairs. But the Colonel was nothing if not regular
in his habits; every autumn he visited, with the utmost
solemnity, an illustrious bootmaker in Oxford
Street; and each impeccable little pair of boots had
signalized the advent of yet another opening meet.
And, since they had been impeccably cared for and
the Colonel seldom hunted more than three days a
week, they had consequently accumulated. As we
walked past them it was as though Lord Roberts
were inspecting the local Territorials, and the Colonel
would have been gratified by the comparison to
that gallant Field-Marshal.</p>

<p class="pindent">It did not strike me at the time that there was
something dumbly pathetic about those chronological
boots with their mahogany, nut-brown, and salmon-coloured
tops. But I can see now that they
symbolized much that was automatic and sterile in
the Colonel’s career. He had retired from the
Army twenty years before, and was now sixty-six,
though active and well preserved. And each of
those twenty years had been as stereotyped as his
ideas. The notions on which he had patterned himself
were part regimental and part sporting. As a
military man he was saturated with the Balaclava
spirit, and one could also imagine him saying,
“Women and children first” on a foundering troopship
(was it the ‘Warren Hastings’ which went
down in the early ’nineties?). But the Boer War
had arrived seven years too late for him, and the
gist of the matter was that he’d never seen any active
service. And somehow, when one came to know
him well, one couldn’t <span class="it">quite</span> imagine him in the
Charge of the Light Brigade: but this may have
been because, in spite of the dashing light-cavalry
tone of his talk, he had served in a line regiment,
and not at all a smart one either. (His affluence
dated from the day when he had married where
money was.)</p>

<p class="pindent">As a sportsman he had modelled himself on what
I may call the Wythe-Melville standard. His conversational
behaviour echoed the sentiments and
skylarking vivacities of mid-Victorian sporting
novels and the coloured prints of a slightly earlier
period. And yet one could no more imagine him
participating in a moonlight steeplechase than one
could visualize him being shot through the Bible in
his breast pocket in a death or glory attack. Like
many chivalrous spirits, he could never quite live
up to the ideal he aimed at. He was always talking
about ‘Brooksby,’ a hard-riding journalist who, in
the Colonel’s heyday, had written regularly for <span class="it">The
Field</span>. He had several volumes of these lively
scribblings and he had read and reread them in his
solitary evenings until he knew the name of every
gorse-covert and woodland in the Shires.</p>

<p class="pindent">But as Stephen might have said (if he’d been
capable of relaxing his admirable loyalty to his godfather),
“The dear old Colonel’s always bucking
about Leicestershire, but I don’t suppose he’s had
half a dozen days there since he was foaled!” And
when the Colonel asked one to dine at ‘the Club’
(“You’ll always find me in town in Ascot week, my
dear boy”), ‘the Club’ (he had two) wasn’t quite
up to the standard he set himself, since instead of
being that full-blown fogeydom ‘the Naval and
Military,’ it had to face things out as merely (“Capital
Club! Lot of nice young chaps there!”) ‘the
Junior.’</p>

<p class="pindent">On this special Sunday, however, I could still
estimate the Colonel’s importance as being equivalent
to twenty-seven pairs of top-boots. In fact,
I thought him a terrific swell, and it wouldn’t have
surprised me to hear that he’d won the Grand National
when he was a gallant young subaltern. At
luncheon (roast beef and apple tart) he was the
most attentive of hosts, and by the time we had
finished our port—(“I think you’ll find this a nice
light-bodied wine. I get it through the Club”)—he
had given most of his favourite anecdotes an airing.
While the decanter was on its way round Stephen
tackled him about the miseries of learning to be a
chartered accountant. The lament was well received,
and when he said, “I’ve been wondering,
Colonel, whether I couldn’t possibly get into the
Gunners through the Special Reserve,” the idea
was considered a capital one.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonel’s face lit up: “I tell you what, my
boy, I’ll write at once to an old friend of mine at
the War Office. Excellent officer—used to be in
the ‘Twenty-Third.’ Very useful man on a horse,
too.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Warmed up by the thought of Stephen getting
a commission, he asked me whether I was in the
Yeomanry. Reluctantly confessing that I wasn’t,
I added that I’d been thinking about it; which was
true, and the thought had filled me with unutterable
alarm. When we rose from our chairs the Colonel
drew my attention to the oil-paintings which
adorned the walls. These were portraits of his past
and present hunters—none of whom, apparently,
“knew what it was to put a foot wrong.” Among
many other relics and associative objects which he
showed us was a large green parrot which he “had
bought from a sailor five-and-twenty years ago.”
He had taught the bird to ejaculate “Tear ’im and
eat ’im,” and other hunting noises. Finally, with
a certain access of grand seigneur dignity, he
waved to us from his front doorstep and vanished
into the house, probably to write a letter to his old
friend at the War Office.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> nine o’clock next morning my cold fingers
were making their usual bungling efforts to
tie a white stock neatly; but as I had never been
shown how to do it, my repeated failures didn’t surprise
me, though I was naturally anxious not to disgrace
the Rectory on my first appearance at a meet
of the Ringwell Hounds. The breakfast bell was
supplemented by Stephen’s incitements to me to
hurry up; these consisted in cries of “Get-along-forrid”
and similar hunt-servant noises, which accentuated
my general feeling that I was in for a
big day. While I was putting the final touches to
my toilet I could hear him shouting to the two
Scotch terriers who were scuttling about the lawn:
(he was out there having a look at that important
thing, the weather).</p>

<p class="pindent">Fully dressed and a bit flurried, I stumped downstairs
and made for the low buzz of conversation in
the dining-room. Purposing to make the moderately
boisterous entry appropriate to a hunting
morning, I opened the door. After a moment of
stupefaction I recoiled into the passage, having beheld
the entire household on its knees, with backs
of varying sizes turned toward me: I had entered
in the middle of the Lord’s Prayer. After a temporizing
stroll on the lawn I re-entered the room
unobtrusively; Stephen handed me a plate of porridge
with a grin and no other reference was made
to my breach of decorum.</p>

<p class="pindent">After breakfast he told me that I’d no more idea
of tying a stock than an ironmonger; when he had
retied it for me he surveyed the result with satisfaction
and announced that I now “looked ready
to compete against all the cutting and thrusting
soldier-officers in creation.”</p>

<p class="pindent">By a quarter past ten the Rector was driving me
to the meet in the buggy—the groom having ridden
his horse on with Stephen, who was jogging sedately
along on Jerry. The Rector, whose overcoat
had an astrakhan collar, was rather reticent,
and we did the five miles to the meet without exchanging
many remarks. But it was a comfort,
after my solitary sporting experiments, to feel that
I had a couple of friendly chaperons, and Stephen
had assured me that my hireling knew his way over
every fence in the country and had never been
known to turn his head. My only doubt was
whether his rider would do him credit. We got to
the meet in good time, and Mr. Whatman, a very
large man who kept a very large livery-stable and
drove a coach in the summer, was loquacious about
the merits of my hireling, while he supervised my
settlement in the saddle, which felt a hard and slippery
one.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I gathered up the thin and unflexible reins I
felt that he was conferring a privilege on me by allowing
me to ride the horse—a privilege for which
the sum of thirty-five shillings seemed inadequate
repayment. My mount was a wiry, nondescript-coloured
animal, sober and unexcitable. It was
evident from the first that he knew much more
about the game than I did. He was what is known
as a ‘safe conveyance’ or ‘patent-safety’; this more
than atoned for his dry-coated and ill-groomed exterior.
By the time I had been on his back an hour
I felt more at home than I had ever done when out
with the Dumborough.</p>

<p class="pindent">The meet was at ‘The Five Bells,’ a wayside inn
close to Basset Wood, which was the chief stronghold
of fox-preservation in that part of the Ringwell
country. There was never any doubt about
finding a fox at Basset. Almost a mile square, it
was well-rided and easy to get about in, though
none too easy to get a fox away from. It was also,
as Stephen remarked when we entered it, an easy
place to get left in unless one kept one’s eyes and
ears skinned. And his face kindled at the delightful
notion of getting well away with the
hounds, leaving three parts of the field coffee-housing
at the wrong end of the covert. It was a grey
morning, with a nip in the air which made him hopeful
that “hounds would fairly scream along” if they
got out in the open and, perhaps for the first time
in my life, I felt a keen pleasure in the idea of sitting
down and cramming my horse at every obstacle
that might come in our way.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime I had got no more than a rough
idea of the seventy or eighty taciturn or chattering
riders who were now making their way slowly along
the main-ride while the huntsman could be heard
cheering his hounds a little way off among the oaks
and undergrowth. I had already noticed several
sporting farmers in blue velvet caps and long-skirted
black coats of country cut. And scarlet-coated
Colonel Hesmon had proffered me a couple
of brown-gloved fingers with the jaunty airified
manner of a well-dressed absent-minded swell. He
was on his corky little grey cob, and seemed to be
having rather a rough ride. In fact the impetuous
behaviour of the cob suggested that the Colonel had
yet to find the key to his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">An open space toward the top end of the wood
formed a junction of the numerous smaller paths
which were tributaries of that main channel—the
middle-ride. At this point of vantage a few of the
more prominent characters from among the field
had pulled up, and since the hounds had yet to find
a fox I was able to take a few observations of people
who afterwards became increasingly familiar to
me in my mental conspectus of the Ringwell Hunt.
Among them was the Master, of whom there is little
to be said except that he was a rich man whose resignation
was already rumoured. His only qualification
was his wealth, and he had had the bad luck
(or bad judgment) to engage a bad huntsman.
Needless to say the Master’s perplexities had been
aggravated by the criticisms and cavillings of subscribers
who had neither the wealth, knowledge, nor
initiative necessary for the office which this gentleman
had found so ungrateful. Much of this I had
already learned at the Rectory, where he was given
his due for having done his best to hunt the country
in handsome style. Sitting there that morning on
a too-good-looking, well-bred horse, he seemed
glum and abstracted, as though he suspected that
most of his field would poke fun at him when his
back was turned. One of his troubles was that he’d
never learnt how to blow his horn properly, and his
inexpert tootlings afforded an adequate excuse for
those who enjoyed ridiculing him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Chief among these was Nigel Croplady. When
I first observed him he was sitting sideways on his
compact short-tailed brown horse; a glossy top-hat
was tilted over his nose. His supercilious, clean-shaven
face was preoccupied with a loose-lipped inspection
of his own left leg; his boot-tops were a
delicate shell-pink, and his well-cleaned white
‘leathers’ certainly justified his self-satisfied scrutiny
of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That blighter’s always talking about getting a
flying-start,” remarked Stephen in an undertone,
“but when hounds run he’s the most chicken-hearted
skirter in Sussex.” I was able to verify
this later in the day when I saw him go irresolutely
at a small fence on a bank, pull his horse across it
with a shout of “Ware wire!” and hustle away in
search of a gate, leaving a hard-riding farmer to
take it in his stride—the wire having been an improvisation
of Croplady’s over-prudent mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">The group which I was watching also included
two undemonstrative elderly men (both of whom,
said Stephen, were fifty pound subscribers and important
covert owners) and several weather-beaten
ladies, none of whom looked afraid of a liberal allowance
of mud and water.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Rev. Colwood (who was on a one-eyed
screw which his soldier-son had picked up for seventeen
pounds at a sale of Army remounts) now
joined the group. He was sitting well forward in
the saddle with the constrained look of a man who
rather expects his horse to cross its front legs and
pitch him over its head. Beside him, on a plump
white weight-carrier, was a spare-built middle-aged
man in a faded pink coat who scattered boisterous
vociferations on everybody within hail.
“Morning, Master. Morning, Mrs. Moffat. Morning,
Nigel.” His beaming recognitions appeared
to include the whole world in a sort of New Year’s
Day greeting. And “Hallo, Stephen ole man,” he
shouted, turning in our direction so suddenly that
his animal’s rotund hind quarters bumped the Rector’s
horse on his blind side and nearly knocked him
over. The collision culminated when he grabbed
my hand and wrung it heartily with the words,
“Why, Jack, my lad, I thought you were still out
in India!” I stared at him astonished, while his
exuberance became puzzled and apologetic.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Is</span> it Jack?” he asked, adding, with a loud laugh,
“No, it’s some other young bloke after all. But
you’re the living split of Steve’s elder brother—say
what you like!”</p>

<p class="pindent">In this way I became acquainted with one of the
most popular characters in the Hunt. Arthur
Brandwick was a doctor who had given up his
small country practice some years before. ‘Always
merry and bright’ was his motto, and he now
devoted his bachelor energies to the pursuit of the
fox and the conversion of the human race to optimism.</p>

<p class="pindent">A solemn purple-faced man, who had been eyeing
me as if he also had his doubts about my identity,
now came up and asked me for a sovereign.
This was Mr. McCosh, the Hunt secretary, and it
was my first experience of being ‘capped’ as a
stranger. I produced the gold coin, but he very
civilly returned it when Stephen informed him that
I was staying at the Rectory.</p>

<p class="pindent">Just as these negotiations concluded, a chorus of
excited hallooings on the outskirts of the wood proclaimed
that Reynard had been viewed by some
pedestrians.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Those damned foot people again! I’ll bet a
tenner they’ve headed him back!” sneered Croplady,
whose contempt for the lower classes was only
equalled by his infatuation for a title. (His family
were old-established solicitors in Downfield, but
Nigel was too great a swell to do much work in his
father’s office, except to irritate the clients, many
of whom were farmers, with his drawling talk and
dandified manners.)</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on, Snowball!” exclaimed Brandwick,
shaking his corpulent white steed into a canter, and
away he went along the main-ride, ramming his hat
down on his head with the hand that held his whip
and scattering mud in every direction.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Chuckle-headed old devil! Mad as a hatter but
as kind-hearted as they make ’em,” said Stephen,
watching him as he dipped in and out of the hollows
with his coat-tails flapping over his horse’s wide
rump. And without any undue haste he started off
along one of the smaller rides with myself and my
hireling at his heels.</p>

<p class="pindent">Everybody hustled away into the wood except
the stolid secretary and two other knowledgeable
veterans. Having made up their minds that the
fox would stick to the covert, they remained stock-still
like equestrian statues, watching for him to
cross the middle-ride. They were right. Fox-hunting
wiseacres usually are (though it was my
wilful habit in those days to regard everyone who
preferred going through a gate to floundering over
a fence as being unworthy of the name of sportsman).</p>

<p class="pindent">Later on, while Stephen and I were touring the
covert with our ears open, we overtook a moody
faced youth on a handsome bay horse. “Hullo,
Tony! I thought you’d parted with that conspicuous
quad of yours at Tatts last week,” exclaimed
Stephen, riding robustly up alongside of him and
giving the bay horse a friendly slap on his hind
quarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">Young Lewison (I remembered what Stephen
had said about him and the expensive hunter which
he ‘couldn’t ride a hair of’) informed us that the
horse had been bought by a Warwickshire dealer
and then returned as a slight whistler. “I’m sick
of the sight of him,” he remarked, letting the reins
hang listlessly on the horse’s neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gazing at the nice-looking animal, I inwardly
compared him with dear old Harkaway. The comparison
was all in favour of the returned whistler,
whose good points were obvious even to my inexperienced
eyes. In fact, he was almost suspiciously
good-looking, though there was nothing flashy
about his fine limbs, sloping shoulders, and deep
chest.</p>

<p class="pindent">“His wind can’t be very bad if you’d never
noticed it,” remarked Stephen, eyeing him thoughtfully,
“and he certainly does look a perfect gentleman.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile the horse stood there as quiet as if he
were having his picture painted. “I wish to goodness
someone would give me fifty pounds for him,”
exclaimed Lewison petulantly, and I had that
queer sensation when an episode seems to have happened
before. The whole scene was strangely lit
up for me; I could have sworn that I knew what
he was going to say before a single word was out of
his mouth. And when, without a second’s hesitation,
I replied, “<span class="it">I’ll</span> give you fifty pounds for him,”
I was merely overhearing a remark which I had
already made.</p>

<p class="pindent">Young Lewison looked incredulous; but Stephen
intervened, with no sign of surprise, “Damn it,
George, you might do worse than buy him, at that
price. Hop off your hireling and see what he feels
like.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I had scarcely settled myself in the new saddle
when there was a shrill halloa from a remote side
of the covert. We galloped away, leaving Lewison
still whoaing on one leg round the hireling, who was
eager to be after us.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m jiggered! What an enterprising old
card you are!” ejaculated Stephen, delightedly
slapping his leg with his crop and then leaning forward
to listen for the defect in the bay horse’s wind.
“Push him along, George,” he added; but we were
already galloping freely, and I felt much more
like holding him back. “Dashed if <span class="it">I</span> can hear a
ghost of a whistle!” muttered Stephen, as we pulled
up at a hunting-gate out of Basset Wood.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’re properly left this time, old son.” He
trotted down the lane and popped over a low heave-gate
into a grass field. My horse followed him
without demur. There wasn’t a trace of the hunt in
sight, but we went on, jumping a few easy fences,
and my heart leapt with elation at the way my
horse took them, shortening and then quickening
his stride and slipping over them with an ease and
neatness which were a revelation to me.</p>

<p class="pindent">“This horse is an absolute dream!” I gasped as
Stephen stopped to unlatch a gate.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Stephen’s face now looked fit for a funeral.
“They must have run like stink and we’ve probably
missed the hunt of the season,” he grumbled.</p>

<p class="pindent">A moment later his face lit up again. “There’s
the horn—right-handed—over by the Binsted covers!”
And away he went across a rushy field as
fast as old Jerry could lay legs to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">A lot of hoof-marks and a gap in a big boundary
fence soon showed us where the hunt had gone. We
were now on some low-lying meadows, and he said
it looked as if we’d have to jump the Harcombe
brook. As we approached it there was a shout from
downstream and we caught sight of someone in distress.
A jolly faced young farmer was up to his
arm-pits in the water with his horse plunging about
beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hullo, it’s Bob Millet and his tubed mare!”
Stephen jumped off Jerry and hurried to the
rescue.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m having the devil’s own job to keep the
water out of my mare,” shouted Millet, who didn’t
seem to be worrying much about getting soaked
to the skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Haven’t you got a cork?” inquired Stephen.
“No, Mr. Colwood, but I’m keeping my finger on
the hole in her neck. She’ll be drowned if I don’t.”</p>

<p class="pindent">This peculiar situation was solved by Stephen,
who held the mare by her bridle and skilfully extricated
her after several tremendous heaves and
struggles.</p>

<p class="pindent">We then crossed the brook by a wooden bridge
a few hundred yards away—young Millet remarking
that he’d never come out again without his cork.
Soon afterwards we came up with the hounds, who
had lost their fox and were drawing the Binsted
covers without much enthusiasm. Colonel Hesmon
commiserated with us for having missed “quite a
pretty little dart in the open.” If he’d been on his
brown mare, he said, he’d have had a cut at the
Harcombe brook. “But this cob of mine won’t
face water,” he remarked, adding that he’d once
seen half the Quorn field held up by a brook you
could have jumped in your boots.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The huntsman now enlivened the deflated proceedings
by taking his hounds to a distant holloa on
the other side of the brook. A man on a bicycle had
viewed our fox returning to Basset Wood. The
bicyclist (Stephen told me as we passed him in the
lane where he’d been providing the flustered huntsman
with exact information) was none other than
the genius who reported the doings of the Hunt for
the <span class="it">Southern Daily News</span>. In the summer he umpired
in county cricket matches, which caused me to
regard him as quite a romantic personality.</p>

<p class="pindent">While they were hunting slowly back to the big
wood on a very stale line, young Lewison reappeared
on my hireling. Looking more doleful than
ever, he asked how I liked Cockbird. Before I had
time to answer Stephen interposed with “He
makes a distinct noise, Tony, and his wind’s bound
to get worse. But my friend Sherston likes the feel
of him and he’ll give you fifty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I concealed my surprise. Stephen had already
assured me that the whistle was so slight as to be
almost undetectable. He had also examined Cockbird’s
legs and pronounced them perfect. Almost
imperceptible, too, was the wink with which Stephen
put me wise about his strategic utterance, and I met
Lewison’s lack-lustre eyes with contrived indifference
as I reiterated my willingness to give him fifty.
Internally, however, I was in a tumult of eagerness
to call Cockbird my own at any price, and
when my offer had been definitely accepted nothing
would induce me to get off his back. We soon
arranged that Mr. Whatman’s second horseman
should call for the hireling at Lewison’s house on
his way back to Downfield.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’ll send you your saddle and bridle to-morrow,”
shouted Stephen, as Cockbird’s ex-owner disappeared
along the lane outside Basset Wood.
“Tony never thinks of anything except getting
home to his tea,” he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">We then exchanged horses, and though the
hounds did very little more that afternoon, our enthusiasm
about my unexpected purchase kept our
tongues busy; we marvelled more and more that
anyone could be such a mug as to part with him for
fifty pounds. As we rode happily home to the
Rectory Cockbird jogged smoothly along with his
ears well forward. Demure and unexcited, he appeared
neither to know nor to care about his change
of ownership.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mr. Pennett can go to blazes!” I said to myself
while I was blissfully ruminating in my bath before
dinner. Stephen then banged on the door and
asked if I intended to stay in there all night, so I
pulled the plug out, whereupon the water began to
run away with a screeching sound peculiar to that
particular bathroom. (Why is it that up-to-date
bathrooms have so much less individuality than
their Victorian ancestors? The Rectory one, with
its rough-textured paint and dark wooden casing,
had the atmosphere of a narrow converted lumber-room,
and its hotwater pipes were a subdued orchestra
of enigmatic noises.)</p>

<p class="pindent">While the water was making its raucous retreat
my flippant ultimatum to the family solicitor was
merged in a definite anxiety about paying for
Cockbird. And then there was (an additional
fifteen guineas) the question of my subscription to
the Ringwell.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, you’ll enter him for our point-to-point,”
Stephen had said while we were on our way
home. “He’s a lot faster than Jerry, and he’ll
simply walk away with the Heavy Weights. Send
in your sub. and start qualifying him at once.
You’ve only got to bring him out eight times. He’s
done nothing to-day, so you can have him out again
on Wednesday.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The idea of my carrying off the Colonel’s Cup
had caused me delicious trepidations. But now, in
the draughty bathroom and by the light of a bedroom candle,
I was attacked by doubts and misgivings.
It was easy enough for Stephen to talk about
‘qualifying’ Cockbird; but how about my own
qualifications as a race-rider? The candle flickered
as if in ominous agreement with my scruples. There
was a drop of water on the wick and the flame
seemed to be fizzling toward extinction. Making it
my fortune-teller, I decided that if it went out I
should fall off at the first fence. After a succession
of splutters it made a splendid recovery and
spired into a confident survival.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">At the dinner-table the Rector glowed with austere
geniality while he carved the brace of pheasants
which represented a day’s covert-shooting he’d had
with Lord Dumborough—“a long-standing annual
fixture of mine,” he called it. During our day’s
hunting we had only caught occasional glimpses of
him. But he had got away from Basset Wood with
the hounds, and had evidently enjoyed himself in
his reticent way. We discussed every small detail
of our various experiences. Kind Mrs. Colwood
kept up with the conversation as well as could be
expected from an absentee who hadn’t ridden since
she was quite a girl. She was interested and
amused by hearing all about who had been out and
what they had said, but she obviously found some
difficulty in sharing her husband’s satisfaction
about the clever way in which ‘Lord Nelson’ (the
one-eyed horse) had popped over a stile with an
awkward take-off and a drop on the landing-side.
She must have endured many anxious hours while
her family were out hunting, but her pinnacle of
perturbation had been reached when Stephen rode
in the Hunt Races—an ordeal which (unless Jerry
went lame) was re-awaiting the next April. She
could never be induced to attend ‘those horrible
point-to-points’ which, as she often said, would be
the death of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">On this particular evening my new horse was
naturally the main topic, and his health was drunk
in some port which had been ‘laid down’ in the
year of Stephen’s birth. After this ceremony the
Rector announced that he’d heard for certain that
the Master was sending in his resignation.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Here’s to our next one,” he added, raising his
glass again, “and I hope he’ll engage a first-rate
huntsman.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I assumed a sagacious air while they deplored the
imperfections of Ben Trotter, and the way he was
forever lifting his hounds and losing his head.
Stephen remarked that whatever those humanitarian
cranks might say, there was precious little
cruelty to foxes when they were being hunted by
a chap like Ben, who was always trying to chase his
fox himself and never gave his hounds a chance to
use their noses. The Rector sighed and feared that
it was no use pretending that the Ringwell was anything
but a cold-scenting country. We then adjourned
to the study, where we soon had our noses
close to the ordnance map. At this moment I can
see Mr. Colwood quite clearly. With a slight frown
he is filling his pipe from a tin of ‘Three Nuns’ mixture;
on the wall behind him hangs a large engraving
of ‘Christ leaving the Praetorium.’</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">E</span>arly</span> in the afternoon of the following
Thursday I journeyed homeward in the jolting
annex of a horse-box. Although it was a sort
of fifth-class compartment I felt serenely contented
as I occasionally put my hand through the aperture
to stroke Cockbird’s velvet nose. He appeared
to be a docile and experienced railway
traveller, and when he stepped out of the box at
Dumbridge Station he had an air of knowing that
he’d saved himself a twenty-mile walk. The porters
eyed him with the respect due to such a well-bred
animal. Having arranged for my kit-bag to
be conveyed to Butley on the carrier’s van, I
swung myself into the saddle which I had borrowed
from the Colwoods. It was a mellow
afternoon for mid-winter, and our appearance, as
reflected in the Dumbridge shop-windows, made
me feel what, in those days, I should have called ‘a
frightful nut.’ Cockbird’s impeccable behaviour
out hunting on the previous day had increased my
complacency, and it was now an established fact
that I had got hold of a top-hole performer with
perfect manners.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nobody at home was aware of what I’d been up
to down in Sussex, and Dixon got the surprise of
his life when we clattered into the stable-yard. So
far as he was concerned it was the first really independent
action of my career. When I arrived he
was having his tea in his cottage above the coach-house;
I could hear him clumping down the steep
wooden stairs, and I sat like a statue until he
emerged from the door by the harness-room with
his mouth full of bread and butter. The afternoon
was latening, but there was, I think, a quietly
commemorative glow from the west. He stood
with the sunset on his face and his final swallowing
of the mouthful appeared to epitomize his astonishment.
Taken aback he undoubtedly was, but his
voice kept its ordinary composure. “Why, what’s
this?” he asked. I told him.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn behaved like a brick about Cockbird.
(How was it that bricks became identified
with generous behaviour?) Of course she admired
him immensely and considered it very clever of me
to have bought him so cheap. But when it came
to writing out the cheque for him I was obliged,
for the first time in my life, to ask her to lend me
some money. She promised to let me have it in a
few days.</p>

<p class="pindent">Next morning she went to London, “just to do
a little Christmas shopping at the Army and Navy
Stores.” I was in the drawing-room when she
returned. I heard the dog-cart drive up to the
front door, and then Aunt Evelyn’s voice telling
Miriam how tired she felt and asking her to make
some tea. I didn’t bother to get up when she came
into the room, and after replying to my perfunctory
inquiry whether she’d had a good day she went
to her bureau and fussed about with some papers.
Somewhat irritably I wondered what she was in
such a stew about as soon as she’d got home. Her
quill-pen squeaked for a short time and then she
came across to the arm-chair where I was sitting
with Edmund Gosse’s <span class="it">Father and Son</span> on my
knee.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There, dear. There’s the money for your
horse, and the Hunt subscription as well.” She
placed a cheque on the arm of the chair. “It’s your
Christmas present,” she explained. It was so unexpected
that I almost forgot to thank her. But
I had the grace to ask whether she could really
afford it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, dear,” she said, “to tell the truth, I
<span class="it">couldn’t</span>. But I <span class="it">can</span> now.” And she confessed
that she’d sold one of her rings for seventy-five
pounds up in London. “And why not?” she asked.
“I’m so delighted at your having taken up hunting
again; it’s such a healthy hobby for a young
man, and Dixon’s almost beside himself—he’s so
pleased with the new horse. And after all, dear,
I’ve got no other interest in the whole world except
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Miriam then appeared with the tea-tray, and
soon afterwards I went upstairs to gloat over my
good fortune.</p>

<div><h1 id="ch6"><span style="font-size:larger"><span class="it">Part Six</span></span><br> THE COLONEL’S CUP</h1></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>y</span> the end of February I had made further
progress in what I believed to be an important
phase of my terrestrial experience. In other
words (and aided by an exceptionally mild winter)
I had averaged five days a fortnight with the
hounds. I had, of course, confided in Dixon my
intention of entering Cockbird for the Ringwell
Heavy-Weight Race. My main object now
seemed to be to jump as many fences as possible
before that eventful day arrived. Meets of the
Dumborough had been disregarded, and a series of
short visits to the Rectory had continued the
‘qualifying’ of Cockbird. (‘Qualifying’ consisted
in drawing the Master’s attention to the
horse during each day’s hunting; and I did this
more than conscientiously, since Stephen and I
were frequently shouted at by him for ‘larking’
over fences when the hounds weren’t running.)</p>

<p class="pindent">The problem of Harkaway’s lack of stamina
had been solved by Dixon when he suggested that
I should box him to the Staghound meets. He
told me that they generally had the best of their
fun in the first hour, so I could have a good gallop
and bring the old horse home early. This took me
(by a very early train from Baldock Wood) to a
new and remote part of the county, and some of
the fun I enjoyed there is worth a few pages of
description.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Coshford Vale Stag Hunt, which had been
in existence as a subscription pack for about half
a century, had been kept on its legs by the devoted
efforts of a group of prosperous hop-farmers and
a family of brewers whose name was a household
word in the district. <span class="it">Gimling’s Fine Ales</span> were a
passport to popularity, and the genial activities of
Mr. ‘Gus’ Gimling, who had been Master for
more years than he cared to count, had kept the
Hunt flourishing and assured it of a friendly reception
almost everywhere in the country over
which it hunted (described in the scarlet-covered
Hunting Directory as “principally pasture with
very little plough”). This description encouraged
me to visualize an Elysium of green fields and
jumpable hedges; but the country, although it
failed to come up to my preconceived idea of its
charms, included a nice bit of vale; and in those
days there was very little wire in the fences.</p>

<p class="pindent">I need hardly say that, since stags were no
longer indigenous to that part of England, the
Coshford stag-hunters kept theirs at home (in a
deer paddock a few miles from the kennels). The
animal which had been selected to provide the day’s
sport was carried to the meet in a mysterious-looking
van, driven by the deerkeeper, a ruddy
faced Irishman in a brown velveteen jacket who
had earned a reputation for humorous repartee,
owing to the numerous inquiries of inquisitive persons
on the roads who asked him what he’d got in
that old hearse of his.</p>

<p class="pindent">Provincial stag-hunts are commonly reputed to
be comic and convivial gatherings which begin with
an uproarious hunt-breakfast for the local farmers.
Purple-faced and bold with cherry brandy,
they heave themselves on to their horses and set off
across the country, frequently falling off in a
ludicrous manner. But the Coshford sportsmen,
as I knew them, were businesslike and well-behaved;
they were out for a good old-fashioned
gallop. In fact, I think of them as a somewhat
serious body of men. And since the field was
mainly composed of farmers, there was nothing
smart or snobbish about the proceedings.</p>

<p class="pindent">I need hardly say that there was no levity in my
own attitude of mind when I set out for my first
sample of this new experiment in sportsmanship.
In spite of talking big to Dixon the night before,
I felt more frightened than light-hearted. For I
went alone and knew no one when I got there.
Dixon had talked to me about Harry Buckman,
who acted as amateur huntsman and was well
known as a rider at hunt races all over the county.
That was about all I’d got to go on, and I gazed
at Buckman with interest and admiration when he
tit-tupped stylishly past me at the meet with his
velvet cap cocked slightly over one ear. Buckman
was a mixture of horse-dealer and yeoman farmer.
In the summer he rode jumpers in the show ring.
His father had hunted a pack of harriers, and it
was said that when times were bad he would go
without his dinner himself rather than stint his
hounds of their oatmeal.</p>

<p class="pindent">Roughly speaking, young Buckman’s task as
huntsman was twofold. Firstly, he was there to
encourage and assist the hounds (a scratch pack—mostly
dog-hounds drafted from foxhound kennels
because they were over-sized) in following the trail
of their unnaturally contrived quarry; secondly,
he had to do everything he could to prevent his
hounds from ‘pulling down’ the deer. With this
paradoxical but humane object in view he had once
jumped a railway gate; by this feat of horsemanship
he arrived in the nick of time and saved the
deer’s life. Fast hunts were fairly frequent, but
there were slow hunting days when scent was bad
and the Coshford subscribers were able to canter
along at their ease enjoying a pretty bit of hound-work.
Sometimes the uncarted animal got clean
away from them, and there was a special interest
attached to a meet when they drew for an outlying
deer.</p>

<p class="pindent">My first day with the Staghounds was on Christmas
Eve and I find the following entry in my
diary: “<span class="it">Coshford</span>; <span class="it">Packman’s Green</span>. Perfect
hunting day; came on wet about 2.30. Turned
out at Hazelpits Farm and ran well to Wissenden,
then on by Chartley Church and Henhurst down
the hill and on towards Applestead. Took deer
(‘Miss Masterful’) about 2. Nine-mile point.
Harkaway in good form. Took a toss over a stile
toward the end. Very nice country, especially the
first bit.” From this concise account it may seem
as if I had already mastered the Coshford topography,
but I suspect that my source of information
was a paragraph in a local paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">I cannot remember how I made myself acquainted
with the name of the deer which provided
the nine-mile point. But in any case, how much
is taken for granted and left unrecorded in that
shorthand description? And how helpful it would
have been now if I had written an accurately observed
and detailed narrative of the day. But
since the object of these pages is to supply that
deficiency I must make my reminiscent deductions
as best I can. And those words from my diary do
seem worth commenting on—symbolic as they are
of the equestrian equilibrium on which my unseasoned
character was trying to pattern itself. I
wrote myself down that evening as I wanted myself
to be—a hard-bitten hunting man, self-possessed
in his localized knowingness and
stag-hunting jargon. The words might well have
been penned by a middle-aged sheep-farmer, or
even by Mr. ‘Gus’ Gimling himself. “Took a
toss over a stile” is the only human touch. But
taking tosses was incidental to the glory of being
a hard rider. What I ought to have written was—that
I couldn’t make up my mind whether to go
at it or not, and the man behind me shouted “go on
if you’re going,” so I felt flustered and let Harkaway
rush at it anyhow and then jerked his mouth
just as he was taking off, and he didn’t really fall,
but only pecked badly and chucked me over his
head and then stood quite still waiting for me to
scramble up again, and altogether it was rather an
inglorious exhibition, and thank goodness Stephen
wasn’t there to see it. For though Stephen and I
always made a joke out of every toss we took, it
wouldn’t have suited my dignity if he’d told me in
cold blood that I was still a jolly rotten rider—the
tacit assumption being that my falls were entirely
due to my thrusting intrepidity.</p>

<p class="pindent">It will be noticed that no mention is made of the
method by which ‘Miss Masterful’ was ‘taken,’
although I had witnessed that performance for the
first time in my life. As far as I can recollect,
Miss M. having decided that the show had lasted
long enough, plunged into a small pond and stood
there with only her small head appearing above
the muddy water. Raucous ratings and loud
whip-crackings restrained the baying hounds from
splashing in after her, and then genial Mr. Gimling,
assisted by one of the whiskered wiseacres of
the hunt (in a weather-stained black coat which
came nearly down to his knees, white cord breeches,
black butcher-boots, and very long spurs), began
to get busy with a long rope. After Miss M. had
eluded their attempts several times they succeeded
in lassooing her head and she was persuaded to
emerge from the pond. She was then frog-marched
away to a farm building, where she
awaited the arrival of her conveyance, which was
cruising about the country and usually put in an
appearance much earlier than might have been expected.</p>

<p class="pindent">It can also be inferred from my diary that the
weather ‘came on wet’ as soon as I’d started my
ten-mile ride back to the railway-station and
Harkaway’s horse-box, and that the supporters of
the Coshford Hunt departed in different directions
wishing one another a merry Christmas and
a happy New Year. It may also be inferred that
poor Miss Masterful sweated and shivered in the
barn with heaving sides and frightened eyes. It
did not occur to me to sympathize with her as I
stood at the entrance to watch them tie her up. I
only wondered how far I was from the station and
my poached eggs for tea. Any sympathy I had
was reserved for Harkaway, who looked as if he’d
had more galloping than was good for him. But
when I was jogging back by Chartley Church,
with my coat collar turned up and the rain soaking
my knees, I chuckled to myself as I thought
of an amusing incident which had happened earlier
in the day.</p>

<p class="pindent">We were galloping full-tilt along a road just
outside a cosy village. An angry faced old parson
was leaning over his garden gate, and as we clattered
past he shook his fist at us and shouted
“Brutes! brutes!” in a loud unclerical voice. Excited
and elated as I was, I turned in the saddle
and waved my whip derisively at him. Silly old
buffer! And what a contrast to that jolly sporting
parson in a low-crowned top-hat who went so
well and came up and talked to me so nicely while
Miss Masterful was being hauled out of the pond!</p>

<p class="pindent">I have analysed the orthodox entry in my diary
more fully than I had intended. But how lifelessly
I recover the breathing reality of which those
words are the only relics. The night before hunting:
the anxious wonderings about the weather;
lying awake for a while with busy thoughts about
to-morrow that grow blurred with the beginning
of an untroubled sleep. And then Miriam battering
on the door with “it’s twenty to seven, sir,” and
the first look at the quiet morning greyness, and
the undefinable feeling produced by the yellow
candlelight and the wintry smelling air from the
misty garden. Such was the impermanent fabric
as it unfolded: memory enchants even the dilatory
little train journey which carried my expectant
simplicity into the freshness of a country seen for
the first time. All the sanguine guesswork of youth
is there, and the silliness; all the novelty of being
alive and impressed by the urgency of tremendous
trivialities.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> end of February became the beginning
of March, and this unavoidable progression
intensified my anticipations of the date in April
which meant so much to me. Cockbird had done
his eight qualifying days without the slightest mishap
or the least sign of unsoundness. He was so
delightfully easy to handle that my assurance as a
rider had increased rapidly. But in the period of
preparation Dixon and I, between us, carried a
large invisible load of solicitude and suspense.
Our conversational demeanour was jauntily portentous.
But when I was alone with myself and
indoors, I often felt so nervous that the month-long
remoteness of the point-to-points became almost
unbearable. My confidence in Cockbird’s
ability to carry off the Colonel’s Cup served only
to magnify my imaginations of what might go
wrong in the race through my own lack of experience.</p>

<p class="pindent">I consoled myself with day-dreams in which I
won in every way that my limited racing repertory
could contrive. There was cantering home an easy
winner; and there was winning cleverly by half a
length; and there was coming up with a rush to
score sensationally in the last stride. Easy winner
lacked intensity; I would have preferred something
more spectacular and heroic. But this was difficult
to manage; I couldn’t win with my arm in a sling
unless I started in that condition, which would be
an anti-climax. On the whole I was in favour of
a fine finish with Stephen, although even this
seemed inappropriate because Jerry was believed
to be much slower than Cockbird, and could only
hope to win if I fell—a thought which reduced
my suppositions to reality.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile Cockbird existed unperturbed,
munching large feeds of crushed oats (with which
Dixon mixed some water, for he had an idea that
this was good for his wind) and doing three hours’
steady work on the road every day. Once a week
we took him to a ten-acre field on a hillside, which
a well-disposed farmer allowed us to use for gallops.
Round and round we went with set and
serious faces (Dixon riding Harkaway), until we
had done three presumptive miles up and down
hill. When we pulled up Dixon would jump off,
and I would jump off to stand meekly by the
horse’s snorting heads while he fussed around
Cockbird with as much solemnity and solicitude as
if he were a Grand National favourite. And, so
far as we were concerned, ‘the National’ (which
was to be run ten days before the Ringwell Heavy-Weight
Race) was quite a secondary affair, though
we sometimes talked about it in an offhand way
which might have led a stranger to suppose that
either of us might slip up to Liverpool to see it,
provided that we could spare the time. Neither of
us doubted that Cockbird himself could ‘get
round Aintree’ if asked to do so. He was, we
agreed, a regular National stamp of horse, and
though I had never seen an Aintree fence, I was
quite sure that no fence was too big for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">On some such afternoon (for we always went
out in the afternoon, though before breakfast
would have been more correct, but it would have
made the day so long and empty), on some such
afternoon, when Cockbird had done his gallop to
our mutual satisfaction and we were jogging
quietly home, with the sun making haloes on the
fleeces of the sheep who watched us pass—on some
such afternoon, I repeat, I was reminded of the
old days when I was learning to ride the cob Sheila,
and of how I used to ask Dixon to pretend to be
Mr. MacDoggart winning the Hunt Cup. Such
a suggestion now would have struck both of us
as unseemly; this was no time for such childish
nonsense as that (though, when one came to think
of it, twelve years ago wasn’t such a very long time
and ‘the twenty hop-kilns’ were still down there in
the valley to remind me of my childish excitement
about them). But the thought passed through my
mind, and at the same moment the warning whistle
of a train going along the Weald would remind
me of that interrogative railway journey which
the three of us would be making in not much more
than two weeks’ time—was it really as near as that
now?</p>

<p class="pindent">The thought of Mr. MacDoggart’s remote victories
at Dumborough Races made me wish that I
could ask Dixon for some first-hand information
about race-riding. But although he had once
worked in a racing-stable, he’d never had an opportunity
of riding in a race. And I was shy of asking
him questions which would expose my ignorance
of things which, for some reason, I supposed that
I ought to have known; so I had to make the best
of such hints as he dropped me.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there was the difficulty of dress, a subject
on which he never offered advice. Desperately
in need of information, I asked myself what I was
to wear on my head. Stephen had worn some
sort of cap last year, but the idea of buying a
jockey-cap seemed somehow ludicrous. (I remembered
the old brown corduroy one I wore on my
first day with the Dumborough.)</p>

<p class="pindent">On this particular afternoon I had shortened my
stirrups by several holes. I had observed, in some
steeplechasing photographs in an illustrated paper,
that the jockeys rode with their knees ever so much
higher than mine. This experiment caused me to
feel important and professional but less secure in
the saddle. And when Cockbird made a sudden
swerve (quite needlessly alarmed by a blackbird
that flew out of the hedge which we hugged so as
to make the field as large as possible) I almost lost
my balance; in fact I nearly fell off. Dixon said
nothing until we were on our way home, and then
he merely remarked that he’d never believed in
riding very short. “They always say that for a
point-to-point there’s nothing like sticking to the
old-fashioned hunting seat.” I took the hint,
which was a wise one.</p>

<p class="pindent">Much depended on Cockbird; but much more
depended on me. There were moments when I
felt acutely conscious of the absolute nullity of my
past as a race-rider. It wasn’t easy to discuss the
event when one was limited by a tacit avowal that
one had no idea what it would feel like. The void
in my experience caused circumlocutions. My
only authority was Stephen, whose well-known
narrative of last year’s race I was continually paraphrasing.
The fact that the Ringwell country was
so far away from our own familiar hunts added to
the anxious significance of my attempt. How could
we—humble denizens of an inglorious unlimited
region—hope to invade successfully the four-day-a-week
immensity which contained the Colonel and
his coveted Cup?</p>

<p class="pindent">Such was the burden of my meditations while I
lugged the garden roller up and down the tennis
lawn after tea, while the birds warbled and scolded
among the laurels and arbutuses in the latening
March twilight and Aunt Evelyn tinkled Handel’s
‘Harmonious Blacksmith’ on the piano in the
drawing-room.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> will have been observed that, in the course of
my career as a sportsman, I was never able to
believe that I could do a thing until I had done it.
Whatever quality it was which caused this tentative
progress toward proficiency, it gave intensity
to everything that I did. I do not claim that it was
unusual—this nervousness of mine about my first
point-to-point race. On the contrary, I am sure
that it was a normal and exemplary state of mind.
Anyone who cares to do so is at liberty to make fun
of the trepidations which a young man carries
about with him and conceals. But there is a risk
in such ridicule. As I remember and write, I grin,
but not unkindly, at my distant and callow self and
the absurdities which constitute his chronicle. To
my mind the only thing that matters is the resolve
to do something. Middle-aged retrospection may
decide that it wasn’t worth doing; but the perceptions
of maturity are often sapless and restrictive;
and “the thoughts of youth are long, long
thoughts,” even though they are only about buying
a racing-cap.</p>

<p class="pindent">A week before the Races I went to London and
bought a cap with a jutting peak; it was made of
black silk, with strings that hung down on each
side until they had been tied in front. I had remarked,
quite casually, to Stephen, that I supposed
a top-hat was rather uncomfortable for racing, and
he had advised me about the cap, telling me to be
sure to get one which came well down over my ears,
“for there’s nothing that looks so unworkmanlike
as to have a pair of red ears sticking out under
your cap.” Whereupon he pulled one of mine,
which, as he said, were big enough to catch any
wind there was.</p>

<p class="pindent">I also bought a weight-cloth. The Heavy-Weight
Racers had to carry fourteen stone, and
after Dixon had weighed me and my hunting
saddle on the old weighing machine in the harness-room,
we came to the conclusion that, assuming
our antiquated machine to be accurate, I should
be required to carry twelve pounds of lead.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank heaven it wasn’t thirteen,” I thought,
as I went into the stable to give Cockbird a few
well-washed carrots.</p>

<p class="pindent">He certainly was looking an absolute picture,
though Dixon said he’d like to get a shade more
of the meat off him. As he nipped playfully at my
sleeve I marvelled at my good fortune in being the
possessor of such unparalleled perfection.</p>

<p class="pindent">With an access of elation, I ran back to the house
in a hailstorm. The sun was out again by the
time I was upstairs brushing my hair for luncheon.
I got out my new cap and tried it on before the
glass. Then Miriam bumped into the room with
a can of hot water, and as I hadn’t time to snatch
it off I stood there with the strings hanging down,
looking, no doubt, a bit of a fool.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, sir, you did give me a turn!” she ejaculated,
“I’d hardly have known you in that there jockey-cap!”
She added that I’d be the death of them all
before I’d done.</p>

<p class="pindent">During luncheon Aunt Evelyn remarked that
she did so hope it wouldn’t be wet for the point-to-points.
She had never seen one in her life, but
she had once been to Dumborough Races, which
she considered dangerous. Fortunately for her
peace of mind, she still visualized a point-to-point
as a sort of paper-chase, and I had said nothing to
counteract this notion, although I did not want to
minimize the grandeur of next week’s events.
Aunt Evelyn’s intense love of horses made Cockbird
the object of an admiration which almost
equalled my own. This, combined with her unshakeable
faith in Dixon, gave her a comfortable
feeling that I was quite safe on Cockbird. But
when Miriam, rather tactlessly, blurted out, “Mr.
George hasn’t half got a lovely jockey-cap!” she
showed symptoms of alarm.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, I do hope the jumps won’t be very big!”
she exclaimed. To which I replied, somewhat
boastfully, that I meant to get over them whatever
they might be like.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m going over to walk round the course with
Stephen on Sunday. He says it’s a course that
wants knowing,” I said, helping myself to some
more tapioca pudding.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen had warned me that I shouldn’t be able
to stay at the Rectory for the Races, because his
mother was already “in such a muck-sweat about
it” that the topic was never touched on in her presence.
So I bicycled to Dumbridge, took the slow
train which explored Sussex on Sunday mornings,
got out at a wayside station, and then bicycled another
seven miles to the course. (The seven-mile
ride saved me from going on to Downfield and
changing on to the branch line which went to the
station close by the course.) These exertions were
no hardship at all on that dusty spring day; had
it been necessary, I would gladly have bicycled all
the whole thirty miles from Butley and back again.
Nothing in my life had ever appeared more imperative
than that I should walk round that “three
and a half miles of fair hunting country” and
memorize each obstacle in the sequence. I wanted
to carry home in my cranium every inch of the
land over which Cockbird would, I strenuously
hoped, stride with his four legs.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime I had plenty to occupy my mind
pleasantly as I pedalled seriously along the leafless
lanes. I already knew that part of the Ringwell
country moderately well; I could identify most of
the coverts by their names, and I ruminated affectionately
on the rainy February days when I
had gone round and through them in a hot and
flustered gallop with the mud from the man in
front of me flying past my head. Eagerly I recognized
the hedges and heave-gates which I had
jumped, and the ruddy faces of the Ringwell
sportsmen accompanied my meditations in amicable
clusters.</p>

<p class="pindent">Memories within memories; those red and black
and brown coated riders return to me now without
any beckoning, bringing along with them the
wintry smelling freshness of the woods and fields.
And how could I forget them, those evergreen
country characters whom once I learnt to know by
heart, and to whom I have long since waved my
last farewell (as though at the end of a rattling
good day). Sober-faced squires, with their civil
greetings and knowing eyes for the run of a fox;
the landscape belonged to them and they to the
homely landscape. Weather-beaten farmers, for
whom the activities of the Hunt were genial interludes
in the stubborn succession of good or bad
seasons out of which they made a living on their
low-lying clay or wind-swept downland acres.
These people were the pillars of the Hunt—the
land-owners and the farmers. The remainder were
merely subscribers; and a rich-flavoured collection
of characters they were, although I only half-recognized
them as such while I was with them.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was loquacious old Mr. Dearborn; formerly
a none too successful stockbroker, and now
a gentleman of leisure, who enjoyed himself on a
couple of spavined screws which (he continually
asserted) were worth at least a couple of hundred
apiece and as clever as cats, though he’d never
given more than thirty pounds for a horse, and
rarely went as high as that; both of them, as
Stephen said, looked lonely without a gig behind
them. Old Dearborn jabbered his way through
the days, attaching himself to one group of riders
after another until a fox was found; at the end of
a good hunt he would always turn up again, puffing
and blowing and purple in the face, but voluble
with enthusiasm for the way his horse had got over
“one of the ugliest places you ever saw in your
life.” However tedious he may have been, the
Ringwell field wouldn’t have been the same without
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Many an exuberant voice and lively countenance
I could revive from that vanished cavalcade. But
I can’t help thinking that the best man of them all
was ‘Gentleman George,’ as we called him.
George was a grey-haired groom; Mr. Clampton,
his middle-aged master, was ‘something in the
City’—a natty untalkative little man, who came
out in queerly cut clothes and a low-crowned hat.
Mr. Clampton kept three stout-hearted weight-carriers,
but he seldom hunted more than one day
a week. George put in as many days as possible;
he called it “keeping the guv’nor’s ’osses well in
work.” No day was too long and no fence too
hairy for George and the guv’nor’s ’osses. At the
most remote meets he would trot up—his fine-featured
open face subdued to the decorum of
servitude and a jolly twinkle for ever lurking in
his keen eyes. (He was a man who could condense
more meaning into a single wink than most political
speakers can put into a peroration.) Always
he had his free and easy hail for the hunt-servants
(to whom he could generally give some useful information
during the day); for the gentry he
reserved a respectful rap of his hat-brim and a
sonorous “Mornin’, sir.” However curt his utterances
were, the tones of his voice seemed to imply
the underlying richness and vigor of his vitality.
He knew every inch of the country backwards, and
the short-tailed grey who was his favorite had done
fourteen seasons with those hounds since Mr.
Clampton first bought him as a five-year-old from
a farm in County Waterford.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great joke about George was his method of
acting as second horseman when his worthy master
was out hunting. This, of course, should have
meant that he kept as much as possible to the roads
and handed the horse over to his employer as soon
as the first horse had done as much galloping and
jumping as was considered good for him. Not so
George, who was seldom more than two fields away
from hounds however hard they ran. Times without
number I have seen him come crashing through
some black-looking fence and then turn to shout
back at the irresolute Mr. Clampton, “Shove ’im
at it, sir; there’s a big old ditch on the landing-side!”
And at the end of a gallop, when both
horses were smoking hot, he would dismount with
the utmost gravity and exchange horses with his
master, who had even been known to go home first,
leaving his privileged retainer to knock holes in the
fences in a late afternoon hunt.</p>

<p class="pindent">In him I seem to be remembering all that was
warm-hearted and exhilarating in my days with
the Ringwell, for he showed a special interest in
Stephen Colwood and myself, and was never so
well-contented as when he was showing us the way
over an awkward place or giving us the benefit of
his ripe experience and intimate knowledge. There
was something noble about him. And so (I choose
to think) it was for ‘Gentleman George’ that I
kept the kindliest of my meditations as I was
bicycling to the point-to-point course.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">It was peaceful and pleasant to be squatting on
a gate and opening the package of sandwiches that
Miriam had made me. The gate opened on to a
boggy lane which ran through Crutchett’s Wood—a
well-known covert. But Crutchett’s Wood was
beginning to look more idyllic than sporting now;
it was dotted with primrose bunches, and the wild
anemones were numerous. Although I saw them
with placid appreciation my uppermost thought
was that the country was drying up nicely; deep
going was believed to be a disadvantage to Cockbird,
who was supposed to possess a turn of speed
which he would have more chance of showing if the
ground were dry.</p>

<p class="pindent">The early afternoon was quiet and Sunday-like
as I sat with half a ham-sandwich in my hand; a
saffron butterfly fluttered aimlessly along the
hedge; miles away the grey-green barrier of the
downs overlooked the inactive Weald, and I
thought I’d rather like to be up there, by the old
windmill on Ditchbury Beacon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Discarding this unsportsmanlike notion I went
on my way; half an hour later my uncompanioned
identity had been merged in my meeting with
Stephen and we were very deliberately inspecting
the first few fences. There was a stake-and-bound
hedge on a bank which we didn’t much like the look
of. While we were still planted in front of it the
cheery voice of Arthur Brandwick hailed us with
“That’s a place where you’ll have to take a pull at
your old horse, Steve.” With him was Nigel Croplady,
wearing white gaiters and puffing a cigar; his
somewhat supercilious recognition of my existence
made me feel that I had no business to be there at
all. Croplady was on the Point-to-Point Committee;
he had helped to plan out the course and had
supervised the making up and trimming of the
fences.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m not at all sure we oughtn’t to have made
the course a bit stiffer,” he remarked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Brandwick replied that he wouldn’t be saying
that if he were having a bump round it himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Croplady expressed regret that he wasn’t able to
ride the horse he’d entered for the Heavy Weights.
“That infernal knee of mine went groggy again
while I was playing golf on Thursday. But I’ve
got ‘Boots’ Brownrigg to ride him for me, so he
ought to be in the picture all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I gathered that ‘Boots’ Brownrigg was in the
‘Blues’ and had “ridden a clinking good finish at
the Guards’ Meeting at Hawthorn Hill the
other day.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Brandwick told us that he’d asked Roger Pomfret
to ride his young horse. “He’s a mutton-fisted
beggar; but the horse is a bit nappy, and young
Roger’ll be the man to keep him going at his
fences.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Every syllable they uttered made my own private
aspirations more preposterous and perishable:
my optimism was at a very low ebb as we plodded
across a wet pasture to the next obstacle, which had
a wide ditch on the take-off side.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s another place where there’ll be trouble
for somebody!” Brandwick’s jolly voice seemed
to be glorying in the prospect of horses refusing
and riders shooting up their necks, or even
over their ears. He turned to me. “Let’s see,
you’re running that nice-looking bay of yours,
aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">I replied, “Yes, I’m having a ride.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Croplady became knowledgeable about the entries,
which had long been a subject for speculation
between Stephen and myself. “Quite a hot lot for
the Heavy Weights this year. Two of those
Cavalry thrusters who keep their nags in Downfield.
They’re always rather an unknown quantity.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen remarked that the Colonel’s Cup was
well worth winning, and Croplady agreed that it
was a much better pot than the Light-Weight one,
and must have cost the old boy five-and-twenty
quid at least.</p>

<p class="pindent">Silent and disheartened, I longed to be alone
again; the presence of the other two made it impossible
for me to talk naturally to Stephen, and I
couldn’t help feeling that they regarded me as an
entry which could be ruled out of all serious consideration.
The whole affair had become bleakly
detached from my previous conception of it. I was
just a greenhorn. What chance had I got against
Brownrigg of the ‘Blues,’ or those ferociously
efficient Cavalry officers? Bicycling back to the
station with only just time to catch the train, I
visualized myself refusing the first fence and colliding
with Roger Pomfret, who was associated in
my memory with all my most timorous experiments
with the Dumborough.</p>

<p class="pindent">Aunt Evelyn found me an uncommunicative
companion that evening; and it wasn’t easy to talk
to Dixon about the course when I went to the
stable next morning. “I hear there’s a very hot lot
entered for the Heavy Weights,” I said, as I
watched him polishing away at Cockbird’s glossy
coat. My tone was, perhaps, a shade extenuatory.
I couldn’t bring myself to speak of Brownrigg of
the ‘Blues.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon straightened himself and passed his hand
along Cockbird’s back. “Don’t you worry about
that. I’ll bet our horse gives some of ’em a shaking
up!” he replied.</p>

<p class="pindent">Cockbird gave a playful hoist of his hind quarters
and then snatched a mouthful of hay from his
rack. I wished that the confidence of my confederates
was a little more infectious.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> races were to be on Wednesday. After
exercising our minds on the problem how
best to convey Cockbird to the course by two
o’clock on that afternoon, we decided against his
spending the previous night in Downfield. I suggested
that he would probably sleep better in his
own stable, which struck me at the time as being
improperly expressed, though it was necessary that
he should lie down and shut his eyes like everybody
else who has something important to do next day.
In this connection I should like to mention an odd
fact, which is that when I dream about horses, as
I often do, they usually talk like human beings, although
the things they say, as in most dreams, are
only confused fantasias on ordinary speech.</p>

<p class="pindent">Anyhow, it was arranged that Dixon should ride
Cockbird to Dumbridge on Wednesday morning,
box him to Downfield, put him up at Whatman’s
‘Hunting and Livery Stables’ for two or three
hours, and then jog him quietly out to the course,
which was about four miles from Downfield. In
the meantime I was to ride Harkaway to Dumbridge
(I felt that this ride would be better for me
than if I drove in the dog-cart), catch a later train,
and find my way out to the course as best I could.
The bag holding my coat, boots, cap, spurs, and
weight-cloth would go by the carrier. (I mention
these details because they did seem so vastly important
at the time.)</p>

<p class="pindent">Cockbird’s night’s rest was, I imagine, normal,
and it didn’t occur to me to speculate about Dixon’s.
My own slumbers were what I should then
have considered inadequate; that is to say, I lay
awake for a couple of hours and then slept like a
top until Miriam called me at eight.</p>

<p class="pindent">I came down to breakfast reticent and self-conscious.
Patient Miriam’s anxiety that I should
eat a good breakfast wasn’t well received, and
Aunt Evelyn’s forced cheerfulness made me feel
as if I were going to be hanged in the afternoon.
She had never made any reference to the possibility
of her going to see the Races. I have no
doubt that she was as sensitive to the precarious
outcome of the adventure as I was. For me the
whole day, until my race started, was pervaded by
the sinking sensation which is commonly called being
in a blue funk. But when the stable-boy (his
face clearly showing his awareness that he was at
close quarters with momentous happenings) had
led Harkaway out of the stable, and I had mounted
and was trotting through the village, I was conscious
of being as fit as I’d ever been in my life,
and of being in some way harmonious with the
mild, half-clouded April morning which contained
me.</p>

<p class="pindent">The morning tasted good; but it had only one
meaning: it was the morning of the point-to-points.
To have understood the gusto of that physical experience
would have been to destroy the illusion
which we call youth and immaturity—that unforeseeing
actuality which retrospection can transmute
into a lucid and orderly emotion. The April morning,
as I see it now, symbolized a stage which I had
then reached in my earthly pilgrimage.</p>

<p class="pindent">But whatever “bright shoots of everlastingness”
my body may have felt, my ordinary mind manifested
itself only by instructing me to feel in my
coat pocket for the half-sheet of notepaper on
which I had written “This is to certify that Mr.
G. Sherston’s bay gelding Cockbird has been fairly
and regularly hunted with the Ringwell Hounds;”
to which the M.F.H. had appended his signature,
adding the figures of the current hunting season,
which I had carelessly omitted. This document
had to be shown at the scales, although when I
actually got there the Clerk of the Scales forgot
to ask me for it. When I was making sure that it
was still in my pocket I was still under the misapprehension
that unless I could produce it in the
weighing tent I should be disqualified from riding
in my race.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the middle of the village I met John Homeward
and his van. He was setting out on his
monotonous expedition to the county town, and I
stopped for a few words with him. His benevolent
bearded face made me feel more confident, and so
did his gruff voice when he took a stumpy clay
pipe out of his mouth to wish me luck.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve asked Tom to put half a crown on for me,”
he said; “it’ll be a great day for Butley if you
win!” His blunt nod, as I left him sitting under
the shadow of his hooded van, was a send-off which
stiffened my faltering ambition to prove myself
worthy of being the owner of Cockbird.</p>

<p class="pindent">Remembering how I’d bicycled off to the Ringwell
Meeting twelve months before, I thought how
flabbergasted I should have been if I’d been told
that I should be riding in a race there next year.
And in spite of that persistent sinking sensation, I
was thankful that, at any rate, I had got as far as
‘having a bump round.’ For whatever might happen,
I was much superior to any of the spectators.
Taking my cap off to two elderly ladies, the Miss
Pattons, who passed me on their tricycles with bobs
and smiles, I wondered whether it was going to
rain. Perhaps the sun came out to show that it
was going to be a fine afternoon. When I was on
the main road I passed Joey, the lizard-faced
stone-breaker, who looked up from his flint-hammering
to salute me with a grin.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun was still shining when I got to the
course; but it was now less easy to believe that I
had engaged myself to contribute to the entertainment
which was attracting such a crowd of cheerful
country folk. I felt extraneous and forlorn.
Everyone else seemed intent on having as good a
time as possible on such a lovely afternoon. I had
come briskly out from Downfield on a two-horse
charabanc which was waiting outside the station.
The journey cost half a crown. Several of my fellow
passengers were ‘bookies’ and their clerks,
with their name-boards and giant umbrellas; their
jocosities accentuated the crudity of the impact on
my mind made by the realistic atmosphere of racing.
I did my best to feel as much like a ‘gentleman-rider’
as I could, and to forget that I was
making my first appearance in a race.</p>

<p class="pindent">The air smelt of trodden turf as I lugged my
bag (loaded with fourteen one-pound lead weights)
into the dressing-room, which was in a farm building
under some elms on the crest of the rising
ground which overlooked the sparsely flagged
course. After dumping the bag in a corner of the
dry-mud floored barn, I went out to look for Cockbird
and Dixon. They were nowhere to be seen,
so I returned to the dressing-room, reminding myself
that Dixon had said he wouldn’t bring ‘our
horse’ out there any earlier than he was obliged to,
since it would only excite him; I also realized that
I should get ‘rattled’ myself unless I kept quiet
and reserved my energies for three o’clock.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first race was run at two, and mine was the
third event on the card, so I bought that absorbing
document and perched myself on an old corn-bin
to peruse it. “<span class="it">Riders are requested to return their
number-cloths to the Clerk of the Scales immediately
after each race.</span>” I had forgotten that
number-cloths existed, so that was news to me.
“<span class="it">These Steeplechases are held subject to National
Hunt Rules as to corrupt and fraudulent practices.</span>”
A moment’s reflection convinced me that I
need not worry about that admonition; it was sufficiently
obvious that I had a clean sheet under
National Hunt Rules, though it flattered me to
feel that I was at last within their jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="pindent">After these preliminaries I looked inside the
card, at the entries. Good heavens, there were
fourteen in my race! Several of the names I didn’t
know. Captain Silcock’s ‘Crumpet.’ Mr. F.
Duckwith’s ‘Grasshopper.’ Those must be the
soldiers who hunted from Downfield. Mr. G.
Bagwell’s ‘Kilgrubbin III.’ That might be—yes,
of course it was—the fat little man on the weedy
chestnut, who was always refusing small timber
out hunting. Not much danger from him as long
as I kept well out of his way at the first fence; and
probably he, and several of the others, wouldn’t go
to the post after all. My own name looked nice.</p>

<p class="pindent">A blue-jowled man in a yellow waistcoat hurried
in, exclaiming, “Can anybody lend me a weight-cloth?”
I glanced at my bag and resolved that
nothing would induce me to lend him mine (which
had yet to receive its baptismal instalment of
sweat). Several riders were now preparing for
the first race, but no one took any notice of me
until ginger-haired Roger Pomfret came in. He
had been inspecting the fences, and he wiped his
fleshy red face with his sleeve as he sat down and
started rummaging in his bag. Tentatively I
asked him what he thought of the course. I was
quite glad to see someone I knew, though I’d have
preferred to see someone else. He chucked me a
surly nod, which he supplemented with—“Course?
I don’t mind telling you, this something course
would break the heart of a blank buffalo. It’s
nothing but twists and turns, and there isn’t a
something fence you could go fast at without risking
your something neck, and a nice hope I’ve got
on that blank sketchy jumper of Brandwick’s!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Before I could think of an answer his boon companion
in blasphemy, Bill Jaggett, came in (embellished
with a brown billycock hat and black and
white check breeches). Jaggett began chaffing him
about the something unhealthy ride he was going
to have in the Heavy Weights. “I’ll lay you a
tenner to a fiver you don’t get round without falling,”
he guffawed. Pomfret took the bet and
called him a pimply faced bastard into the bargain.</p>

<p class="pindent">I thought I might as well get dressed up: when
I had pulled my boots on and was very deliberately
tucking the straps in with a boot-hook, Stephen
strolled in; he was already wearing his faded pink
cap, and the same elongated and anxious countenance
which I’d seen a year ago. No doubt my
own face matched his. When we’d reassured one
another about the superlative fitness of our horses
he asked if I’d had any lunch, and as I hadn’t he
produced a bar of chocolate and an orange, which
I was glad to get. Stephen was always thoughtful
of other people.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shouts of the bookies were now loudening
outside in the sunlight, and when I’d slipped on my
raincoat we went out to see what we could of the
Light-Weight Race.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first two races were little more than the
clamour and commotion of a passing procession.
The ‘Open Race’ was the main excitement of the
afternoon; it was run ‘in colours,’ and there were
about a dozen dashing competitors, several of them
well-known winners in such events.</p>

<p class="pindent">But everything connected with this contest
reached me as though from a long way off, since I
was half-stupefied by yawning nervousness. They
appeared to be accomplishing something incredible
by galloping round the course. I had got to do it
myself in half an hour; and what was worse, Dixon
was relying on me to put up a creditable performance.
He even expected me to give the others ‘a
shaking-up.’ Stephen had ceased to be any moral
support at all; in spite of his success last year he
was nearly as nervous as I was, and when the field
for the Open Race had filed out of the hurdle-guarded
enclosure, which did duty as the paddock,
he disappeared in the direction of Jerry and I was
left to face the future alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Also, as far as I knew, my horse hadn’t yet arrived,
and it was with a new species of alarm that
I searched for him after I had seen the race start;
the Paddock and its environs now looked unfriendly
and forsaken.</p>

<p class="pindent">I discovered my confederates in a quiet corner
under a hayrick. They seemed a discreet and unassuming
pair, but Dixon greeted me with an invigorative
grin. “I kept him away from the
course as long as I could,” he said confidentially;
“he’s as quiet as a sheep, but he knows what he’s
here for; he’s staled twice since we got here.” He
told me that Mr. Gaffikin was about and had been
looking for me. “He says our horse stands a jolly
good chance with the going as good as it is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I said there was one place, in and out of a lane,
where I’d have to be careful.</p>

<p class="pindent">We then escorted Cockbird to the Paddock; by
the time we were there and I’d fetched my weight-cloth,
the Open Race was over and the spectators
were trooping back again. Among them was Mr.
Gaffikin, who hailed me companionably with
“Hullo, old chap; jolly sporting of you to be having
a ride!” and thereafter took complete charge
of me in a most considerate manner, going with
me to the weighing tent with the weight-cloth over
his arm, while I, of course, carried my saddle.</p>

<p class="pindent">The winner of the Open Race was weighing in
when we arrived, and I stepped diffidently on to
the machine immediately after his glorified and
perspiring vacation of the seat. Mr. Gaffikin
doled out a few leads for me to slip into the leather
pouches on the dark blue cloth until I tipped the
scale at fourteen stone. The Clerk of the Scales,
an unsmiling person with a large sallow face—he
was a corn-merchant—verified my name on the
card and handed me my number-cloth and armlet;
my number was seven: under less exacting conditions
I might have wondered whether it was a lucky
number, but I was pushed out of the way by Pomfret.
Arthur Brandwick (in a grey bowler) was
at his elbow, talking nineteen to the dozen; I
caught a glimpse of Stephen’s serious face; Colonel
Hesmon was with him, behaving exactly the same
as last year, except that, having already ‘given the
boy the horse,’ he could no longer say that he was
going to do so if he won the race.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Dixon was putting the last testing touches
to Cockbird’s straps and buckles, the little Colonel
came across to assure me that if Jerry didn’t win
there was no one he’d rather see first past the
judge’s wagon than me. He added that he’d
taken a lot of trouble in choosing the Cup—“very
nice goblet shape—got it from Stegman &amp; Wilks—excellent
old firm in the City.” But his eye wandered
away from Cockbird; his sympathies were
evidently strongly implicated in Jerry, who was as
unperturbed as if he were being put into a
brougham to fetch someone from the station.</p>

<p class="pindent">Near him, Nigel Croplady was fussing round
his horse, with quite a crowd round him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The terrific ‘Boots’ Brownrigg was puffing a
cigarette with apparent unconcern; his black cap
was well over his eyes and both hands were plunged
in the pockets of a short blue overcoat; from one
of the pockets protruded a short cutting whip.
His boots were perfection. Spare built and middle
sized, he looked absolutely undefeatable; and if he
had any doubts about his own abilities he concealed
them well.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stifling another yawn, I did my best to imitate
his demeanour. The bookies were bawling “Two
to one bar one.” Cockbird, stimulated by publicity,
now began to give himself the airs of a real
restive racehorse, chucking his head about, flattening
his ears, and capering sideways in a manner
which caused the onlookers to skip hastily out of
range of his heels.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I say, that’s a classy looking quad!” exclaimed
a youth who appeared to have purchased the Paddock.
He consulted his card, and I overheard his
companion, as they turned away, saying something
about “his jockey looking a bit green.” “We’d
better back Nigel’s horse. They say he’ll win for
a cert.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For want of anything else to do at this critical
moment I asked Dixon whether he’d put Homeward’s
half-crown on. He said, “Yes, sir; Mr.
Gaffikin’s man has just done it for me, and I’ve
got a bit on for myself. <span class="it">It’s a good thing</span>; they’re
laying five to one about him. Mr. Stephen’s horse
is at two’s.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Gaffikin chimed in with “Mikado’s a hot
favorite. <span class="it">Two to one on</span>, all along the line!” Mikado
was Croplady’s horse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Gaffikin then tied the strings of my cap in
a very tight bow; a bell jangled and a stentorian
voice shouted, “Now then, gentlemen, I’m going
down to the post.” The blue sky suddenly went
white; my heart bumped; I felt dazed and breathless.
Then Mr. Gaffikin’s remote voice said, “Let
me give you a leg-up, old chap”; I grabbed hold of
the reins, lifted an awkward foot, and was lifted
airily on the slippery saddle: Cockbird gave one
prance and then stood still; Dixon was holding him
firmly by the head. Pressing my knees into the
saddle I overheard Mr. Gaffikin’s ultimate advice.
“Don’t go in front unless you can help it;
but <span class="it">keep well with ’em</span>.” They both wished me
luck and released me to my destiny.</p>

<p class="pindent">I felt as if I’d never been on Cockbird’s back
before; everything around me appeared unreal and
disconnected from all my previous experience. As
I followed Stephen out of the Paddock in a sort of
equestrian trance, I caught sight of his father’s
face, pale and fixed in its most strenuous expression;
his eyes followed his son, on whose departure
he was too intent to be able to take in anyone else.
We filed through a gate under some trees: ‘Gentleman
George’ was standing by the gate; he stared
up at me as I passed. “That’s the ’oss for my
money,” was all that he said, but his measured tone
somehow brought me to my senses, and I was able
to look about me when we got down to the starting
place.</p>

<p class="pindent">But even then I was much more a passenger
than a resolute rider with his wits about him to
‘pinch’ a good start. There were seven others. I
kept close to Stephen. We lined up uneasily;
while the starter (on his dumpy grey cob) was instructing
us to keep the red flags on the right and
the white flags on the left (which we already
knew) I noticed Pomfret, (on a well-bred, excitable
brown) and Brownrigg (Croplady’s bright
chestnut looking very compact) already stealing
forward on the side furthest from him.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he said “Go” I went with the others, albeit
with no sense of initiative. The galloping
hoofs sounded strange. But Cockbird felt strong
under me and he flicked over the first fence with
level and unbroken stride; he was such a big
jumper and so quick over his fences that I had to
pull him back after each one in order to keep level
with Jerry, who was going his best pace all the
way. One of the soldiers (in a top-hat) was making
the running with Brownrigg and Pomfret
close behind him. At the awkward fifth fence (the
one on a bank) Pomfret’s horse jumped sideways
and blundered as he landed; this caused Pomfret
to address him in uncomplimentary language, and
at the next obstacle (another awkward one) he
ran out to the left, taking one of the soldiers with
him. This, to my intense relief, was the last I saw
of him. I took it at a place where a hole had been
knocked in it in the previous races. The next
thing I remember was the brook, which had seemed
wide and intimidating when I was on foot and had
now attracted a small gathering of spectators.
But water-jumps are deceptive things and Cockbird
shot over this one beautifully: (Stephen told
me afterwards that he’d “never seen a horse throw
such an enormous leap”). We went on up a long
slope of firm pasture-land, and I now became
aware of my responsibility; my arms were aching
and my fingers were numb and I found it increasingly
difficult to avoid taking the lead, for after
jumping a couple more fences and crossing a field
of light ploughland we soared over a hedge with a
big drop and began to go down the other side of
the hill. Jerry was outpaced and I was level with
Mikado and the Cavalry soldier who had been cutting
out the work. As Stephen dropped behind
he said, “Go on, George; you’ve got ’em stone-cold.”</p>

<p class="pindent">We were now more than three parts of the way
round, and there was a sharp turn left-handed
where we entered on the last half-mile of the
course. I lost several lengths here by taking a
wide sweep round the white flag, which Brownrigg
almost touched with his left boot. At the next
fence the soldier went head over heels, so it was
just as well for me that I was a few lengths behind
him. He and his horse were still rolling about on
the ground when I landed well clear of them.
Brownrigg looked round and then went steadily
on across a level and rather wet field which compelled
me to take my last pull at Cockbird. Getting
on to better ground, I remembered Mr.
Gaffikin’s advice, and let my horse go after him.
When I had drawn up to him it was obvious that
Cockbird and Mikado were the only ones left in it.
I was alone with the formidable Brownrigg. The
difference between us was that he was quite self-contained
and I was palpitating with excitement.</p>

<p class="pindent">We were side by side: approaching the fourth
fence from the finish he hit his horse and went
ahead; this caused Cockbird to quicken his pace
and make his first mistake in the race by going too
fast at the fence. He hit it hard and pecked badly;
Brownrigg, of course, had steadied Mikado for the
jump after the quite legitimate little piece of
strategy which so nearly caused me to ‘come unstuck.’
Nearly, but not quite. For after my arrival
at Cockbird’s ears his recovery tipped me
half-way back again and he cantered on across the
next field with me clinging round his neck. At one
moment I was almost in front of his chest. I said
to myself, “I <span class="it">won’t</span> fall off,” as I gradually worked
my way back into the saddle. My horse was honestly
following Mikado, and my fate depended on
whether I could get into the saddle before we arrived
at the next fence. This I just succeeded in
doing, and we got over somehow. I then regained
my stirrups and set off in urgent pursuit.</p>

<p class="pindent">After that really remarkable recovery of mine,
life became lyrical, beatified, ecstatic, or anything
else you care to call it. To put it tersely, I just
galloped past Brownrigg, sailed over the last two
fences, and won by ten lengths. Stephen came in
a bad third. I also remember seeing Roger Pomfret
ride up to Jaggett in the Paddock and inform
him in a most aggressive voice that he’d got to
“something well pay up and look pleasant.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Needless to say that Dixon’s was the first face
I was aware of; his eager look and the way he said,
“Well done,” were beyond all doubt the quintessence
of what my victory meant for me. All else
was irrelevant at that moment, even Stephen’s unselfish
exultation and Mr. Gaffikin’s loquacious
enthusiasm. As for Cockbird, no words could ever
express what we felt about him. He had become
the equine equivalent of Divinity.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Excited as I was, an inward voice cautioned me
to control my volubility. So when I had weighed
in and returned with my saddle to find a cluster of
knowing ones casting an eye over the winner, I
just waited soberly until Dixon had rubbed him
down, mounted, and ridden serenely out of sight.
The Colonel was on the spot to congratulate me on
my ‘nailing good performance’ and, better still, to
give Dixon his due for having got Cockbird so fit.
Those few lofty minutes when he was making
much of his horse were Dixon’s reward for all the
trouble he had taken since Cockbird had been in
his charge. He had needed no such incentive, but
he asked for nothing more. While he was on his
way back to Downfield he may also have thought
to himself how he had made me into a good enough
rider to have got round the course without a catastrophe.
(He had yet to hear full details of the race—including
my peculiar acrobatics toward the
end, which had been witnessed by no one except the
rider of Mikado, who had been kind enough to tell
Croplady that he never saw such a thing in his life,
which was, I hoped, intended as a compliment.)</p>

<p class="pindent">When I had watched Dixon’s departure I found
that public interest was being focused on the
Yeomanry Team-Race. I was glad to slip away
by myself: a few fields out in the country I relaxed
my legs on a five-barred gate and contemplated my
achievement with as much mental detachment as I
could muster. Even in those days I had an instinct
for getting the full flavour of an experience. Perhaps
I was fortunate in not yet having become
aware that the winner of the last race is forgotten
as soon as the next one starts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Forty minutes later I had claimed my cup.
(There was no ceremony of presentation.) Having
crammed the ebony pedestal into my kit-bag I
came out into the Paddock with the cup in my
other hand. It was convenient to carry, for it had
handles to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Good-natured Arthur Brandwick came up and
offered me a lift back to Downfield. While he was
patting me on the back I caught sight of a figure
which seemed somehow familiar. A loose-built
ruddy faced young sportsman was talking to a
couple of jovial whiskered farmers; he sat on a
shooting-stick with his thin neatly gaitered legs
straightened; a brown felt hat was tipped well over
his blunt nose, for the five o’clock sun was glaring
full in his eyes. I wondered who it was he reminded
me of. Brandwick answered my unspoken
question.</p>

<p class="pindent">“D’you twig who that is?” I shook my head.
“Well, take another good look at him. It’s our
new Master, and a hell of a good lad he is, from
all I’ve heard. Up till a month ago everyone
thought the country’d have to be hunted by a Committee
next season. There was something fishy
about every one of the coves who’d applied for the
Mastership. And then this chap wrote and offered
to hunt the hounds himself and put up fifteen hundred
a year if we guaranteed him another two
thousand. Hardly a soul knew about it till to-day.
We’re lucky to get him. He’s been hunting a
good rough country in Ireland the last two seasons
and showing rare sport. He’s run across for a
couple of days to have a look at us.” As we
walked away the new Master turned his head and
favoured us with a slow and rather blank stare.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What did you say his name was?” I asked,
when we were out of earshot. Brandwick informed
me that his name was Milden—Denis Milden—and
I knew that I’d known it all the time, though
I hadn’t set eyes on him since I was eleven
years old.</p>

<p class="pindent">Aquamarine and celestial were the shoals of
sunset as I hacked pensively home from Dumbridge.
The Colonel’s Cup clinked and joggled
against my saddle. Time was irrelevant. But I
was back at Butley by eight o’clock, and Cockbird,
who had returned by an earlier train, was safe and
sound; a little uneasily he wandered around his
loose-box, rustling the deep straw, but always going
back to the manger for another mouthful of
clover-hay. Dixon serenely digested triumph with
his tea; presently he would go out to the ‘Rose and
Crown’ to hand Homeward his multiplied half-crown
and overawe the gossips with his glory.</p>

<p class="pindent">Absolved and acquiescent was the twilight as I
went quietly across the lawn and in at the garden
door to the drawing-room. Aunt Evelyn’s arm-chair
scrooped on the beeswaxed floor as she
pushed it back and stood up with her bottle of
smelling-salts in her hand. For the first time since
my success I really felt like a hero. And Miriam
served the dinner with the tired face of a saint that
seemed lit with foreknowledge of her ultimate reward.
But at that time I didn’t know what her
goodness meant.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of our evening, when they had gone
upstairs with my highly coloured history of the day
in their heads, I strolled out into the garden; for
quite a long time I stared at the friendly lights
that twinkled from the railway-station and along
the dark Weald. I had brought something home
with me as well as the Cup. There was this new
idea of Denis Milden as Master. For I hadn’t
forgotten him, and my persistent studying of
<span class="it">Horse and Hound</span> and <span class="it">The Hunting Directory</span>
had kept me acquainted with his career as an amateur
huntsman since he had left Oxford. A dog
barked and a train went along the Weald .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
last train to London, I thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Going back to the drawing-room, I lit a pair of
candles which made their miniature gold reflections
on the shining surface of the massive Cup. I
couldn’t keep my eyes away from it. I looked
round the shadowed room on which all my childhood
and adolescence had converged, but everything
led back to the talisman; while I gazed and
gazed on its lustre I said to myself, aloud, “It can’t
be true that it’s really there on the table!” The
photograph of Watts’s ‘Love and Death’ was there
on the wall; but it meant no more to me than the
strangeness of the stars which I had seen without
question, out in the quiet spring night. I was secure
in a cosy little universe of my own, and it
had rewarded me with the Colonel’s Cup. My last
thought before I fell asleep was, “Next season I’ll
come out in a pink coat.”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll</span> through an extra fine summer I often
wondered how the new Master was getting
on in the Ringwell country. But I was almost
entirely ignorant of what a Master of Hounds
does with himself between April and September.
I saw next to nothing of Stephen, who was at Aldershot,
learning how to be a Special Reserve officer
in the Royal Field Artillery.</p>

<p class="pindent">My own energies were mainly expended on club
cricket matches. I managed to play in three or
four matches every week; I was intent on keeping
my batting average up to twenty runs per innings,
which I found far from easy, though I had one
great afternoon when I compiled a century for
Butley against some very mediocre village bowling.
Those long days of dry weather and white
figures moving to and fro on green grounds now
seem like an epitome of all that was peaceful in
my past. Walking home across the fields from
Butley, or driving back in the cool of the evening
after a high-scoring game on the county ground at
Dumbridge, I deplored my own failure or gloated
over one of my small successes; but I never looked
ahead, except when I thought about next winter’s
hunting. The horses were out at grass; and so, in
a sense, was I.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now and again I accompanied Aunt Evelyn to
a garden party where, as a rule, I competed in a
putting tournament, which was a favorite mode of
entertainment at the time. Solemnly round someone’s
garden I putted, partnered, perhaps, by a
major’s wife or a clergyman’s daughter. At
Squire Maundle’s I won a magnifying glass, and
on another occasion I carried off a carriage-clock.
Aunt Evelyn, who preferred croquet, was extremely
pleased, and my leisurely conquests among
herbaceous borders and yew hedges accentuated
the unique pride I had in my racing Cup. In an
exciting match-play final on Captain Huxtable’s
mossy and evergreen-shaded lawn I just failed to
capture an ivory paper-knife.</p>

<p class="pindent">One week-end in July Stephen came to stay with
us. Artillery life had caused no apparent change
in him. We indulged in cheerful nostalgia for the
chase. After sniffing the trussed hay in the stable-barn,
we contemplated Cockbird and Harkaway in
the paddock. We sighed for a nice moist winter
morning. Stephen was hoping to get ‘attached’ to
some Gunners who were conveniently stationed in
the Ringwell country. He could tell me nothing
about the new Master, except that he was already
reputed to be a tireless worker and very well liked
by the farmers. For his benefit I unearthed my
early impressions of Denis Milden as I had seen
him when he was staying at Dumborough Castle
as a boy. Already Milden was a very great man
in our minds.</p>

<p class="pindent">My memory of that summer returns like a bee
that comes buzzing into a quiet room where the
curtains are drawn on a blazing hot afternoon.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">By the middle of September Dixon had got the
horses up from grass. Cricket matches were out of
season, but there hadn’t been a spot of rain since
the end of June. Robins warbled plaintively in
our apple orchard, and time hung rather heavy on
my hands. The Weald and the wooded slopes
were blue misted on sultry afternoons when I was
out for a ruminative ride on one of my indolent
hunters. Hop-picking was over early that year
and the merry pickers had returned to the slums
of London to the strains of the concertina or accordion.
I was contemplating an expedition to the
West End to order a short-skirted scarlet coat and
two pairs of white breeches from Kipward &amp; Son:
Craxwell was to make me a pair of boots with mahogany
coloured tops. I intended to blossom out
at the opening meet as a full-fledged fox-hunter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The autumn was a period of impatience. I
longed for falling leaves and the first of November.
The luminous melancholy of the fine September
weather was a prelude rather than an elegy. I was
only half in love with mists and mellow fruitfulness.
I did not dread the dark winter as people
do when they have lost their youth and live alone
in some great city. Not wholly unconscious of the
wistful splendor, but blind to its significance, I
waited for cub-hunting to end. Europe was nothing
but a name to me. I couldn’t even bring myself
to read about it in the daily paper. I could,
however, read about cubbing in the Midlands; it
was described at some length every week in the
columns of <span class="it">Horse and Hound</span>. Any other interests
I had are irrelevant to these memoirs, and were
in any case subsidiary to my ambition as a sportsman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Disapproving Mr. Pennett had left me severely
alone since the previous winter, and for the time
being my income seemed adequate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Toward the end of the month Stephen asked me
to stay at the Rectory. He had escaped from Aldershot
and was about to join his new brigade,
which was quartered in the Ringwell country.
Both his brothers were still serving their country
in foreign parts.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first morning I was there we got up at four
o’clock, fortified ourselves with boiled eggs and
cocoa, and set off on bicycles to a cubbing meet
about eight miles away. The ground was still as
hard as a brick, and we had decided to save the
horses’ legs for later on and see what we could
‘from our flat feet.’ Cock-crowing dimness became
daylight; the road was white and dry, but the air
smelt of autumn. I saw Milden again, in the glinting
rays of a quiet scarlet-orbed sunrise; he was
on a compact little roan horse; among his hounds
outside some gryphoned lodge-gates he leant forward
in diplomatic conference with a communicative
keeper. The ‘field’ consisted of a young lady
with a cockaded groom and a farmer on an unclipped
and excited four-year-old. A few more
riders turned up later on when the hounds were
chivvying an inexperienced cub up and down a
wide belt of woodland. After the first invigorating
chorus in the early morning air had evoked our
enthusiasm the day soon became sultry: pestered
by gnats and flies we panted to and fro, and then
followed the hunt to another big covert.</p>

<p class="pindent">By ten o’clock we had both of us lost our early
ardour; they had killed a cub and now a brace had
gone to ground in a warren. Stephen told me that
the Master was mad keen on digging out foxes,
which in that and many other parts of the country
were too plentiful for good sport later in the season.
While cheering his hounds up and down the
woods he had several times passed us; but he was
engrossed in his job and scarcely gave us a glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">When we arrived at the rabbit-warren I could
at first see nothing of him but the back of his old
mulberry coat; his head and shoulders were half
underground; he had just put a terrier in and was
listening intently for muffled subterranean barkings.
Stephen got into conversation with Will, the
first whip, who was an old friend of his, since he’d
been second-whip under the previous huntsman
(the ineffectual Ben Trotter). I didn’t dare to
hope that Milden would remember me, but when
he straightened himself and swivelled a jolly red
face in my direction I gazed at him with humble
expectancy.</p>

<p class="pindent">I drew his face blank; for his eyes travelled on
toward the first whip and he exclaimed, with the
temporary Irish brogue which he had acquired
while he was hunting the Kilcurran Hounds,
“They’re a tarrible long time bringing those
spades, Will!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Whereupon he picked up his heavy-thonged crop
and whistled some baying and inquisitive bitches
away from the rabbit-hole, addressing them in the
unwriteable huntsman’s lingo which they appeared
to understand, judging by the way they looked up
at him. “Trinket .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good ole gal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. here;
Relic; Woeful; Bonnybell; get along bike there,
Gamesome .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good little Gamesome”—with affectionate
interpolations, and an aside to Will that
that Windgall was entering first-rate and had been
right up in front all the morning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “throwing
your tongue a treat, weren’t ye, little Windgall?”
Windgall jumped up at him and flourished her
stern.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon afterwards the second-whip rode through
the undergrowth encumbered with spades, and they
took their coats off in the dappling sunshine for a
real good dig. The crunch of delving spades and
the smell of sandy soil now mingled with the redolence
of the perspiring pack, the crushed bracken
that the horses were munching, and the pungent
unmistakable odour of foxes. However inhumane
its purpose, it was a kindly country scene.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well enough I remember that September morning,
and how, when I offered to take a turn with
one of the spades, Denis Milden looked at me and
said, “Haven’t I seen ye somewhere before?” I
answered shyly that perhaps he’d seen me at the
point-to-points. It seemed providential when Will
reminded him that I’d won the Hunt Heavy
Weights. Milden casually remarked, “That must
be a good horse of yours.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Emboldened by this, I asked whether by any
chance he remembered meeting me out with the
Dumborough nearly fourteen years before. But
for the life of him he couldn’t recollect that. “Ye
see I’ve seen such a tarrible lot of new people since
then!” he remarked cheerily, pushing his blue velvet
cap up from a heated brow. Nevertheless, I
toiled back to the Rectory well satisfied with the
way I’d managed to remind him of my undistinguished
identity, and Stephen exulted with me that
the new Master was such an absolutely top-hole
chap. “Not an atom of swank about him.” It is
quite possible that we may both of us have talked
with a slight Irish accent when we were telling the
attentive Rector all about it during luncheon.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ctober</span> arrived; the drought broke with
forty-eight hours’ quiet rain; and Dixon had
a field day with the new clipping machine, of which
it is enough to say that the stable-boy turned a handle
and Dixon did the rest. He had decided to clip
the horses’ legs this season; the Ringwell was a bad
country for thorns, and these were, naturally less
likely to be overlooked on clipped legs, which also
were more sightly and dried quicker than hairy
ones.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Only bad grooms let their horses get cracked
heels,” was one of his maxims. “Only lazy grooms
wash the mud off with water” went without saying.</p>

<p class="pindent">We often spoke about the new Master, who was
already the sum and substance of my happy hunting-ground
thirty miles away. Dixon remembered
him distinctly; he had always considered him the
pattern of what a young gentleman ought to be.
Frequently I wished Aunt Evelyn’s sedate establishment
could be transplanted into that well-foxed
and unstagnant county. For one thing it was
pretty poor fun for Dixon if I were to be continually
boxing Cockbird and Harkaway to Downfield
or staying at the Rectory; but Dixon seemed
satisfied by the bare fact of my being a hunting
man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Resplendent in my new red coat, and almost too
much admired by Aunt Evelyn and Miriam, I
went off to the opening meet by the early train
from Dumbridge to Downfield. Half an hour’s
ride took me to the kennels, where I joined an impressive
concourse, mounted, in vehicles, and on
foot. The sun shone after a white frost, and everyone
was anxious to have a look at the new Master.
My new coat was only a single spot of colour
among many, but I felt a tremendous swell all the
same. Familiar faces greeted me, and when we
trotted away to draw Pacey’s Plantation, old Mr.
Dearborn bumped along beside me in his faded red
coat and blue and white spotted bird’s-eye cravat.
“This horse ought to have one of you young chaps
on his back!” he exclaimed. “Jumps too big for
an old duffer like me; never known him put a foot
wrong, clever as a cat—(<span class="it">hold up, will you!</span>)” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
his clever hunter having tripped badly on some
stones.</p>

<p class="pindent">He presented me to an affable person on the
other side of him—Mr. Bellerby, of Cowslake
Manor. Mr. Bellerby was mounted on a fidgety,
ewe-necked, weak-middled, dun-coloured mare.
He had a straggling sandy beard and was untidily
dressed in new clothes which looked all wrong. He
seemed to have put them on in a hurry—baggy
black coat half-unbuttoned—spurs falling back
from loose-fitting patent-leather boots, starched
stock with a horseshoe pin insecurely inserted—badly
cut white corduroy breeches; and an absurdly
long cane hunting-crop without a thong. He had
a mackintosh coat rolled up and strapped on the
back of his saddle. He wore moss-green worsted
gloves, and his mare’s bridle had a browband of
yellow and black striped patent-leather.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Dearborn remarked, when we lost sight of
him in the crowd outside the covert, that he was a
queer fish to look at, but a very warm man in Mincing
Lane. “Made a pile of money out in the East;
just come to live in our country; built a billiard-room
onto his house, I hear; sort of man who
might be good for a fifty pound subscription,
fear he’s no horseman, however. That dun of his
gallops like a train till she gets near a fence, and
then digs her toes in. I know all about her, for
he bought her in the summer from a neighbour of
mine. Pity he didn’t ask my advice. I’d have let
him have this one for a hundred and twenty. Absolute
patent-safety, this one; jump a house if
you asked him to!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it so happened that the new owner of
Cowslake Manor provided the liveliest incident
that I remember out of that day, which was ‘badly
served by scent’ as the local scribe reported in the
paper. A fox was found in Pacey’s Plantation
(it was hinted that he’d been put there by Mr.
Pacey, a hard-riding farmer who believed in showing
the foot people some fun on an opening day).
The majority of the field hustled round the outside
of the covert, but I thought to be clever and went
through by a grassy ride. A short distance in
front of me galloped Mr. Bellerby; his hat bounced
on his back, suspended by its string, and he was
manifestly travelling quicker than he had intended.
Someone in front pushed through the gate out of
the Plantation, and while we neared it the open
gate was slowly swinging back again. It was uncertain
which would win, Mr. Bellerby or the gate.
I stole past him on his near side, got there just
in the nick of time, and retarded the gate with my
left hand. Mr. Bellerby bolted through the aperture,
narrowly avoiding the gatepost with his right
knee. It was an easily managed exploit on my
part, since I had Cockbird well under control, and,
as usual, he understood what we were about every
bit as well as his owner. Mr. Bellerby continued
his involuntary express journey across a ridge-and-furrow
field, bore down on a weak hedge, swerved,
shot half-way up his mare’s neck, and came to a
standstill while Cockbird was taking the fence in
his stride.</p>

<p class="pindent">After Mr. Pacey’s fox had got into a drain half
a mile further on, Mr. Bellerby reappeared and
besieged me with his gratitude. He really didn’t
know how to thank me enough or how to congratulate
me in adequate terms on what he persisted in
describing as my “magnificent feat of horsemanship.”
It was, he asserted, the most alarming
experience he’d ever had since he was run away
with down a steep hill in a dog-cart years ago in
Surrey; he recalled his vivid emotions on that appalling
occasion. “Shall I jump out, I thought,
or shall I remain where I am? I jumped out! I
shall never forget those awful moments!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Embarrassed by his effusive acknowledgments
I did my best to avoid him during the rest of the
day, but he was constantly attaching himself to
me, and everybody who happened to be near us
had to hear all about my marvellous feat of horsemanship.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not a second to spare! I really think Mr.
Sherston saved my life!” he ejaculated to Sir John
Ruddimore, a stolid and rather exclusive landowner
who followed the hounds very sedately with
an elderly daughter. The local big-wig listened
politely to the story; but I felt a fool, and was
much relieved when I saw the back of Mr. Bellerby
as he tit-tupped away to Cowslake Manor after
pressing me to accept a cheroot about eight inches
long out of a crocodile-skin case.</p>

<p class="pindent">I returned to Butley without having exchanged
a word with Milden. Whenever I saw him his
face was expressionless and he seemed to be unaware
of anything except his hounds and what
they were doing. Nigel Croplady, however, referred
to him by his Christian name and led one
to suppose that he had been indispensable to him
since he had taken the country. But Croplady, I
am very much afraid, was just a little bit of a
snob.</p>

<p class="pindent">For several weeks Milden remained eminently
unapproachable, although I diligently went out
with his hounds, enlarging my equestrian experience
by taking a full thirty-five bobs’ worth out of
Whatman’s hard-legged hirelings. My moneys-worth
included several heavy falls on my hat, but
I took rather a pride in that, since my sole intention
was to impress the Master with my keenness.
Up to Christmas the hounds showed very moderate
sport; scent was bad, but I overheard a lot of
grumbling (mainly from unenterprising riders)
about Milden being such a slow huntsman. Certainly
he seemed in no hurry, but I was always
quite satisfied, myself, as long as I had done plenty
of jumping by the end of a day.</p>

<p class="pindent">And our amateur huntsman, as I afterwards
discovered, knew exactly what he was doing. As
soon as he took over the country he had asserted
his independence by getting rid of the Ringwell
dog-pack, on which the members had always
prided themselves so much. To the prudent protestations
of the Committee he replied bluntly that
although the dog-hounds were all right to listen to
in the woods, they were too slow for words on the
unenclosed downs, and too big and cloddy for the
cramped and strongly fenced vale country. He
added that Ben Trotter had got them into terrible
bad habits and he wasn’t going to waste his time
teaching them how to hunt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Shortly afterwards he had bought five-and-twenty
couple of unentered bitches at Rugby
Hound Sales; so that, when the Ringwell-bred
puppies came in from walk, he began the season
with no less than thirty-seven couple of unentered
hounds. To those people who properly understood
hunting his patient methods must have been a welcome
contrast to the harum-scarum, hoicking, horn-blowing
‘which way’d ’e go?’ performances of the
late huntsman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Denis Milden refused to lift his hounds unless
he was obliged to do so, and in this way he taught
them to hunt on a catchy scent without looking
for help. They learned to keep their noses down,
and day after day Milden watched them worrying
out the barely workable line of a fox who was half
an hour ahead of them; he was deaf to the captious
comments of his field and the loudly offered information
of would-be helpers who knew which way
his fox had gone. The result of this procedure
was that after Christmas, when scenting conditions
improved, the light-boned bitches began to
hunt like blazes; in fact, as he said ‘they fairly
screamed along,’ and of the two packs he really
couldn’t make up his mind which was the better—the
big bitches or the little bitches. When the big
bitches had pushed an old dog-fox out of Basset
Wood and killed him after a fast fifty minutes
with only one check, a six-mile point over all the
best of the Monday country, the little bitches went
one better with a really beautiful hunt from one of
the big gorse coverts on the hills. The grumbling
contingent now forgot that they’d ever uttered a
word of criticism, and for the moment were unable
to exercise their grumbling aptitude at all. But
the real wiseacres, such as Sir John Ruddimore
and Fred Buzzaway, nodded conclusively to one
another, as though agreeing that it was only what
they’d been expecting all the time.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fred Buzzaway, whose name has just cropped
up casually, was a totally different type of sportsman
from that reticent local magnate Sir John
Ruddimore (of Rapworth Park). Always fond
of a joke, Fred Buzzaway was a blue-jowled dog-faced
bachelor, who habitually dressed as though
it were going to be a pouring wet day. Bowler
hat well down over his ears; dark whipcord coat
and serviceable brown breeches; tight and skimpy
stock; such was his rig-out, wet or fine. I see him
now, splashed with mud, his coat collar turned up,
and his head bent against the driving rain. His
boots were usually muddy owing to his laudable
habit of getting off his horse as often as possible
to give it a rest, and during a slow hunt he was
often to be seen leading his mount and even running
beside it. He was an active man on his feet,
and when he wasn’t riding to hounds he was following
a pack of foot-harriers. Stag-hunting he
despised. “Jackasses hunting a carted jackass,”
he called it. In his youth Buzzaway had been
called to the Bar. His friends always said that
when he got there he asked for a bottle of ‘Bass’
and never went back again after he had discovered
his mistake. From this it may be inferred that he
had a wholesome belief in good liquor.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Beer goes well with beagling,” he would remark,
“but after a fox-hunt I feel the need for
something stronger.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Few of my fox-hunting acquaintances seem to
have been taciturn, but Buzzaway, I am inclined
to think, outwent them all in consistent chattiness.
He enjoyed airing his observations, which were
shrewd and homely. He was one of those men
whose personal conviction as to which way the
hunted fox has gone is only equalled by their expert
knowledge, at the end of a gallop, of the
ground he went over. His intimacy with minor
local topography was unsurpassed by anyone I
knew. Even when he had been out with some
neighbouring pack, he could reel off the parish
names like clockwork. When asked what sort of
a day he’d had, he would reply: “Found in
Clackett’s Copse, ran a couple of rings, and then
out by Hogstye, over the old fosse-way, and into
Warthole Wood, where he tried the main-earths
and went on into Cuddleswood Park; along the
Banks and into Hawk’s Rough, back by the Banks
into the Park, left-handed by Warthole Wood
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and so on, until one could almost have believed
that he’d been riding the fox himself instead
of one of his low-priced and persevering hunters.</p>

<p class="pindent">As might be imagined, he was by no means
difficult to get to know. At first I was rather
scared by the noises he made whenever I was anywhere
near him: either he was hustling along close
behind me, shouting “Forrad on,” or else he was
cracking his whip at a straggling hound, or bawling
“Hold up” to his horse at a jump, and I felt
that I should be the next one to get shouted at.
But I soon discovered what a cheery customer he
was, and I became one of his best listeners. Needless
to say, he was on easy terms with the Master,
and it was in his company that I made my first
step toward knowing Milden well.</p>

<p class="pindent">Buzzaway was one of the privileged (or pushful)
people who were sometimes to be seen riding
along a road beside the huntsman, although Milden’s
manner was abstracted and discouraging to
conversation. More than once I had overtaken
the hounds on their way to a meet, but I had always
kept unobtrusively at the rear of the procession,
which included three second-horsemen, one of
them carrying a terrier in a bag. I was so shy that
I scarcely ventured to say good-morning when I
passed Milden at the meet. But one day in the
middle of December I stayed out to the very end
on one of Whatman’s hirelings; as a rule I started
back to Downfield a bit earlier, to catch my train,
but it was getting dark early and the hounds had
been running hard in the big woods all day, changing
foxes several times. Milden was standing up
in his stirrups and blowing his horn; the first whip
was counting the hounds with little wags of his
whips as though conducting a string band. Buzzaway
was taking a long pull at his flask, and everyone
else had gone home. Will announced that
they were all there except Purity.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Blast that Purity!” muttered Milden, whereupon
Purity emerged penitently from the shades
of the covert and the cavalcade moved off along the
lane.</p>

<p class="pindent">So it came about that I found myself riding
mutely along in the middle of the pack with Buzzaway
and the Master. In front of us ‘Toprail,’
the hunting correspondent of the <span class="it">Southern Daily</span>,
wobbled along on his bicycle and accumulated information
from the second-whip, a melancholy
young man named Bill Durrant, whose existence
was made no merrier by the horses he had to ride,
especially the one he was on—a herring-gutted
piebald which, as he had been heard to complain,
was “something crool over timber.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, Master,” remarked Buzzaway, “you
were devilish unlucky when that fresh fox got up
in Cowleas Wood! I viewed your hunted fox going
back to Danehurst Hatch, and he looked so
beat I could almost have caught him myself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Milden tucked his horn into the case on his
saddle. “Beat, was he? We’ll catch him next time,
never you fear. And we’ll hunt <span class="it">you</span> when we get
short of foxes. I’ll be bound you’d leave a good
smell behind you!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Buzzaway grinned with as much pleasure as if
he’d been paid the most graceful of compliments.
Jabber, jabber, jabber went his tongue, undiscouraged
by the inadequate response it met with. And
considering the amount of shouting he’d done during
the day, it wasn’t to be wondered at that
Milden was somewhat silent and preferred to
munch a large brown biscuit which he produced
from his pocket in a twist of paper. Later on, however,
he turned to me and asked if I’d got far to
go. When he heard that I lived thirty miles away
in the next county he said I “must be desperate
keen, to come all that way,” and my heart glowed
with gratitude. But this was nothing compared
with what I felt when he continued, “I tell you
what, I can put you up at the Kennels any time
you like, when you’re having a day with us. It’s
terrible quiet there of an evening, and I’d be glad
of someone to talk to. Just drop me a card the
day before, and bring your horse as well if you
like; or you can find your way out from Downfield
somehow if you’re on one of Whatman’s screws.”
He tickled my hireling’s neck with the end of his
crop. “They earn their keep all right, don’t they?
That poor old sod was out the day before yesterday,
I know, for some silly blighter from the barracks
landed slap in the middle of my hounds on
him. I wish some of those soldiers weren’t quite
so mad on jumping. It’s the only thing they come
out for!”</p>

<p class="pindent">We got to Clumpton crossroads and he said
good-night. Buzzaway and I trotted briskly on
toward Downfield in a drizzle of rain. I could
scarcely believe that I had been invited to stay at
the Kennels, and I listened absent-mindedly to
my companion’s account of a day he’d had with
the Cotswold last season when staying with his
brother. Ordinarily I should have found this interesting,
but the only information I gathered was
that though the Cotswold was a niceish country
for watching hounds work, the Ringwell needed
brains as well as boldness and he asked for nothing
better. I then parted from him and clattered into
Whatman’s cobbled yard.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was close on Christmas, but the weather remained
mild, and in the following week I wrote
a concise letter offering myself as a guest at Ringwell
after Wednesday’s hunting—the meet being
only a few miles from the Kennels. At home I
said not a word about my sudden elevation in the
sporting world, and I allowed Aunt Evelyn to take
it for granted that I was going to Hoadley Rectory.
After I had actually been to the Kennels
I could talk about it, but not before. It was too
important an event for casual conversation, and
even Dixon was kept in the dark about it. Aunt
Evelyn had shown the right amount of interest in
Denis Milden, remembering him as such a nice-looking
boy, and remembering also how she had
come across his people in Northamptonshire when
she was a girl—a well-known sporting family who
had a large place near, she thought, Daventry. I
sometimes wished that my own family was like
that, for the architecture of my existence seemed
meagre, and I wanted to be strongly connected
with the hunting organism which at that time I
thought of as the only one worth belonging to.
And it <span class="it">was</span> (though a limited one) a clearly defined
world, which is an idea that most of us cling
to, unless we happen to be transcendental thinkers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Staying at the Kennels was the most significant
occasion my little world could offer me, and in
order that he might share my sublunary advancement
I took Cockbird with me. In reply to my
reserved little note I received a cheery letter from
Denis: he would be delighted to see me and gave
detailed instructions about my bag being called for
and taken out to the Kennels from Downfield. He
told me to be sure to bring a rug for my horse as
he was “terrible short of clothing.” My belongings
were to be conveyed to the Kennels on the ‘flesh-cart,’
which would be in Downfield that day. I
was surprised that he should take so much trouble,
for I had yet to learn how methodical and thorough
he was in everything which he undertook.</p>

<p class="pindent">I remember nothing of that day’s hunting; but
the usual terse entry in my diary perpetuates the
fact that the meet was at ‘The Barley Mow,’
“Found in Pilton Shaw and Crumpton Osiers, but
did little with either as scent was rotten. Weather
very wet in afternoon; had quite a good hunt of
nearly two hours from Trodger’s Wood; hounds
were stopped in Basset Wood at 4.25.” The concluding
words, “Stayed at the Kennels,” now seem
a very bleak condensation of the event. But it did
not occur to me that my sporting experiences
would ever be called upon to provide material for
a book, and I should have been much astonished if
I could have forseen my present efforts to put the
clock back (or rather the calendar) from 1928 to
1911.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yet I find it easy enough to recover a few minutes
of that grey south-westerly morning, with its
horsemen hustling on in scattered groups, the December
air alive with the excitement of the chase,
and the dull green landscape seeming to respond
to the rousing cheer of the huntsman’s voice when
the hounds hit off the line again after a brief check.
Away they stream, throwing up little splashes of
water as they race across a half-flooded meadow.
Cockbird flies a fence with a watery ditch on the
take-off side. “How topping,” I think, “to be
alive and well up in the hunt”; and I spurt along
the sound turf of a green park and past the front
of a square pink Queen Anne house with blank
windows and smokeless chimneys, and a formal
garden with lawns and clipped yew hedges sloping
to a sunk fence. A stone statue stares at me, and
I wonder who lived there when the house was first
built. “I am riding past the past,” I think, never
dreaming that I shall one day write that moment
down on paper; never dreaming that I shall be
clarifying and condensing that chronicle of simple
things through which I blundered so diffidently.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the day’s hunting is ended, and I must
watch myself jogging back to the Kennels, soaked
to the skin but quietly satisfied in my temporary
embodiment with the Hunt establishment; beneath
a clean-swept sky, too, for the rain-clouds have
gone on with the wind behind them. Soon we are
passing the village green; a quarter of a mile from
the Kennels, Denis Milden blows a long wavering
blast to warn the kennel-man and the head-groom
that we are almost home. When we turn in at a
gate under some trees there are men waiting with
swinging stable-lanterns, which flicker on their red
jerseys, outside the long range of portable loose-boxes
which Denis has put up. He and his whips
are quickly off their horses and into the kennel-yard
among the jostling hounds. He has told me
to find my way indoors and get my tea and a bath.
Cockbird is led into a loose-box under the superior
eye of Meeston, the head-groom, a gruff, uncommunicative
man in a long, dirty white kennel-coat.
Cockbird gives his head a shake, glad to be rid of
his bridle. Then he lowers it, and I pull his ears
for a while—an operation which most horses enjoy
when they are tired. The place is pervaded
by a smell of oatmeal and boiled horseflesh, and
the vociferations of the hounds accompany me as I
tread stiffly through the darkness to a wicket-gate,
and so to the front door of the old wood-built
huntsman’s house—‘the wooden hutch,’ as we used
to call it.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Welcomed by barks from an elderly Aberdeen
and a slim white fox-terrier with a black head, I
followed an expressionless young man-servant up
the narrow staircase to my room, which was furnished
with the bleakest necessities. The house
creaked in the wind, and the geyser in the bathroom
seemed likely to blow up at any moment. I
was downstairs again and had finished my tea before
Denis came in from the kennels. However
late and wet he returned, he always saw his hounds
fed, and it was usually about an hour before he
was inside the house. No professional huntsman
ever worked harder than he did, and he invariably
rode to the meet and home again with his hounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sitting in the poky little living-room on the
ground floor, I was surrounded by all his significant
personal belongings. There were a few photographs,
mostly in silver frames, of his contemporaries
at Eton and Oxford, all in hunting or racing
clothes; the walls were hung with monotonously
executed portraits of horses which he had owned,
and there was one large group of four hounds
which had won a first prize at Peterborough
Hound Show. There was also a coloured drawing
of himself winning a University Steeplechase. A
few standard sporting books (including Lindsay
Gordon’s poems and the leather-backed volumes of
the <span class="it">Foxhound Kennel Stud-Book</span>) filled a small
bookcase. The letters and papers on his writing-table
were very tidily arranged. On the sideboard
were racing-cups and a huge silver tray “presented
by the members of the Kilcurran Hunt as a testimony
of their appreciation of the sport he had
shown them during his Mastership.” There were
several foxes’ masks among the pictures, with
place and date of death in small white lettering:
one or two brushes were tucked behind picture
frames, and a fox’s pad was mounted as the handle
of a paper-knife. Finally (and there was only
just enough room for it) an upright piano with a
pianola apparatus attached to it, demonstrated that
he was fond of a bit of music. A record of
Dvořák’s ‘New World’ Symphony appeared to
be his only link with Europe. But he had the advantage
of me as regards foreign travel, since he
had once been to Budapest to play in a polo
tournament. (He told me this at dinner, when we
were saying how superior the English were to all
foreigners.)</p>

<p class="pindent">It was after half-past six when he came in. He
seemed to take me for granted already, but he assured
me once again that he was “terrible pleased
to have someone to talk to.” He threw off his wet
hunting-coat and slipped into a ragged tweed
jacket which the silent servant Henry held out for
him. As soon as he had swallowed a cup of tea
he lit his pipe and sat down at his writing-table to
open a pile of letters. He handed me one, with a
grimy envelope addressed to “Mr. Milden, The
Dog Kennels, Ringwell.” The writer complained
that a fox had been the night before and killed
three more of his pullets, and unless he could bring
the dogs there soon there wouldn’t be one left and
they’d really have to start shooting the foxes, and
respectfully begging to state that he was owed
fifteen shillings by the Hunt for compensation.
Many of Denis’s letters were complaints from
poultry keepers or from small farmers whose seeds
or sown ground had been ridden over when the
land was wet. I asked what he did with these, and
he replied that he sent them on to old McCosh, the
Hunt secretary. “But when they look like being
troublesome I go over and talk to them myself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I found afterwards that he had a great gift for
pacifying such people, to whom the Hunt might
have been an unmitigated nuisance if it hadn’t been
an accepted institution. The non-hunting farmers
liked to see the Hunt, but they disliked the marks
it left on their land. The whole concern depended
on the popularity and efficiency of the Master, and
the behaviour of the people who hunted. Denis
Milden’s predecessor in the Mastership had been
too lavish with indiscriminate five-pound notes;
consequently the petitioners for compensation had
begun to regard the Poultry and Damage Fund as
a regular friend in need, and complaints from
poultry farmers were far too frequent. To hear
Denis talk about them one might have thought that
hens were the enemies of society instead of being
the providers of that universally respected object,
the egg.</p>

<p class="pindent">Watching him open those letters was an important
step in my sporting education. Until then I
had not begun to realize how much there was to
be done apart from the actual chivvying of the
foxes. Thenceforward I became increasingly
aware that a successful day’s hunting was the result
of elaborate and tactful preparations, and I
ceased to look upon an angry farmer with a pitchfork
as something to be laughed at. In the
meantime I wished he would go upstairs and
change his wet clothes. But he sat there in his
muddy boots for almost an hour, writing letters in
his careful calligraphy and filling in his diary—a
log-book of details such as which horses had been
out, where foxes had been found, and so on.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eight-thirty by the time he’d had his bath
and was shouting from the top of the stairs to
Mrs. Timson, the buxom grey-haired cook, “Mrs.
Timson! Tell Henry to put that dinner on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">When that dinner had been put on and eaten
(there was a large joint of beef, I remember) he
asked me to play some music. I treadled away at
the pianola, while he dozed in a shabby arm-chair
with Moll, the fox-terrier, on his knees, and a litter
of newspapers at his carpet-slippered feet. I had
ambled to the end of a musical comedy arrangement
(‘The Geisha’ I think it was) and was bundling
the perforated music-roll back again with
reverse motion when he suddenly heaved himself
out of the chair, yawned, remarked that he’d give
anything to be able to play the piano properly,
whistled to the dogs, and turned them out into the
night for an airing. He then lit a couple of candles,
extinguished the unshaded oil-lamp, led the
way upstairs, and hoped I’d sleep all right. All
this sounds humdrum, but I have since then spent
many a much duller evening with people who were
under the impression that they were talking brilliantly.
I have never cared greatly about highly
sophisticated persons, although some of them may
seek to enlarge their intellectual experience by
perusing my modest narrative.</p>

<p class="pindent">Lying awake that night I listened to the wind
which was making queer noises round the flimsily
constructed house. Once or twice there was an
outburst of hound music from the kennels.
Through the thin partition wall I could hear the
grunts and snores of the stablemen, whose dormitory
was next to the spare room. The blind on
my window flapped. I thought how different staying
at Ringwell Kennels was from what I’d
expected. Yet it seemed exactly like what it ought
to be. I wondered whether old Cockbird was
asleep out in his loose-box. Thought what an odd
character the head-groom looked, and how surprised
Stephen would be when I told him all about
my visit. Meditated on the difference between
Denis hunting the hounds (unapproachable and
with ‘a face like a boot’) and Denis indoors—homely
and kind and easy to get on with; would
he really want me to come and stay with him again,
I wondered. And then I fell into so sound a sleep
that the stablemen on the other side of the partition
wall failed to awake me when they got up at some
unearthly hour and went down the dark stairs with
their clumping boots to begin their work in the
damp December morning.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>&nbsp;must pass</span> rather rapidly through the remainder
of that season and the one which
followed it. While Denis continued to show splendid
sport, my own achievements included learning
to identify the majority of the hounds by their
names. This I did mainly while ‘walking out’
with them on non-hunting days. The road by the
Kennels had wide green borders to it, and along
these we used to loiter for an hour or two at a time;
the full-fed bitches, their coats sprinkled with
sulphur, were continually being spoken to by name,
and in this way I silently acquired information. I
cannot say that I ever became anything of a judge
of their shape and make, or that my knowledge has
since proved profitable; but I knew Brightness
from Brevity, Ramble from Roguery, and Wavelet
from Watercress, and this enabled me to show an
intelligent interest and to share the Master’s enthusiasm
for his favourites: I could speciously
agree that, although Tempest was a beautiful bitch
to look at, she was by no means what she might
be when it came to hunting. Peerless, on the other
hand, was worthy of her appellation, and frequently
hit off the line when the others were at a
loss to know which way their fox had gone across
a bit of cold ploughland.</p>

<p class="pindent">My regular visits to the Kennels, and the facility
with which I echoed the Master’s ideas and opinions,
bolstered up my self-complacence and gave
me a certain reflected importance among the members
of the Hunt, which I should otherwise have
lacked. I now wore the Hunt button and was regarded
as being ‘in the know’; people like Colonel
Hesmon and Fred Buzzaway would ask me
whether I could tell them where the meets were
likely to be the week after next. A few words of
praise from Denis were, however, what I most
wanted. Opportunities for earning his approval
were not numerous; but now and again, when he
was on a sticky jumper and I happened to be with
him in a run, he would shout “Go on, George.”
Probably there was a big brambly hedge to be got
over, and I would cram at it, not caring whether I
took a heavy fall so long as I had the privilege of
giving him a lead; the bigger the hole I made in
the hedge the better pleased he was. He was a
strong and patient horseman, and since the country
was for the most part rough and ‘trappy’ and the
going deep on the heavy clay soil, he rode very deliberately
at the fences. While everyone else was
fully occupied in keeping with the hounds at all,
Denis never seemed to have half his mind on the
horse he was riding. His eyes were on the hounds,
and he went over the country, as we used to say,
‘as if it wasn’t there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">During January and February in his first season
I had many good days with the Ringwell, riding
anything I could hire or borrow when I hadn’t
one of my own to bring out. Stephen hunted
regularly from his barracks, and shared my appreciation
of Denis. He was ready, he said, to knock
anyone off his horse who uttered a word of criticism
against the huntsman. His main ambition in life
being to hunt a pack of hounds himself, he appointed
himself a sort of amateur second whipper-in,
and he was never so happy as when Denis asked
him to watch the end of a covert or stop some
hounds when they had divided and a few couple
were away on the line of a second fox. Stephen
called me a lucky old devil to be staying at the
Kennels so often. He liked soldiering well enough,
but the horses were his only real interest in life.
The guns, he said, were nothing but a nuisance,
and he, for one, had no wish to chuck shells at
anyone.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the month of March my movements
were restricted by the Coal Strike. There were
no trains, and I missed some of the best hunts of
the season. But I had a few days with the Dumborough
and made myself conspicuous by jumping
every fence I could find.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon, who had been rather out of it, now came
in for the solemnities of preparing Cockbird for
the point-to-points. I ran him in a few ‘Open’
races, but found that he couldn’t go quite fast
enough, though he jumped faultlessly and once
finished third in a field of a dozen. Thanks to his
reliability I was beginning to have quite a high
opinion of myself. The Ringwell Races were late
in April that year. Denis rode his best horse in
the Heavy Weights and beat me by three lengths.
His victory seemed to me quite appropriate, and
everyone wanted him to win. It had never occurred
to me that I should finish in front of him.
Good-natured Mr. Gaffikin was there again to give
me a leg-up, and he praised me for my improved
handling of my horse. He assured me that if I’d
won the Race two years running I should never
have been able to get my hat on again—a remark
which appeared to cause him extreme satisfaction,
for he repeated it more than once, with a lady-killing
laugh. (The inference was that I should
have suffered from ‘a swelled head.’)</p>

<p class="pindent">I saw very little of Denis during that summer,
which was a wet one, and bad for my batting average.
Having made only fifteen runs in my last
seven innings I was glad enough to put away my
cricket-bag, and by the second week in September
I was back at the Kennels for a prolonged stay.
There was a new lot of horses, and Denis, who
badly needed someone to talk to, always had a
spare one for me to ride.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Ringwell cubbing days are among my happiest
memories. Those mornings now reappear in my
mind, lively and freshly painted by the sunshine of
an autumn which made amends for the rainy weeks
which had washed away the summer. Four days a
week we were up before daylight. I had heard the
snoring stable-hands roll out of bed with yawns
and grumblings, and they were out and about before
the reticent Henry came into my room with
a candle and a jug of warm water. (How Henry
managed to get up was a mystery.) Any old
clothes were good enough for cubbing, and I was
very soon downstairs in the stuffy little living-room,
where Denis had an apparatus for boiling
eggs. While they were bubbling he put the cocoa-powder
in the cups, two careful spoonfuls each, and
not a grain more. A third spoonful was unthinkable.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not many minutes afterwards we were out by
the range of loose-boxes under the rustling trees,
with quiet stars overhead and scarcely a hint of
morning. In the kennels the two packs were baying
at one another from their separate yards, and
as soon as Denis had got his horse from the gruff
white-coated head-groom, a gate released the
hounds—twenty-five or thirty couple of them, and
all very much on their toes. Out they streamed
like a flood of water, throwing their tongues and
spreading away in all directions with waving sterns,
as though they had never been out in the world
before. Even then I used to feel the strangeness
of the scene with its sharp exuberance of unkennelled
energy. Will’s hearty voice and the crack
of his whip stood out above the clamour and commotion
which surged around Denis and his horse.
Then, without any apparent lull or interruption,
the whirlpool became a well-regulated torrent flowing
through the gateway into the road, along which
the sound of hoofs receded with a purposeful clip-clopping.
Whereupon I hoisted myself on to an
unknown horse—usually an excited one—and set
off higgledy-piggledy along the road to catch them
up. Sometimes we had as many as twelve miles to
go, but more often we were at the meet in less than
an hour.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mornings I remember most zestfully were
those which took us up on to the chalk downs. To
watch the day breaking from purple to dazzling
gold while we trotted up a deep-rutted lane; to inhale
the early freshness when we were on the sheep-cropped
uplands; to stare back at the low country
with its cock-crowing farms and mist-coiled waterways;
thus to be riding out with a sense of spacious
discovery—was it not something stolen from the
lie-a-bed world and the luckless city workers—even
though it ended in nothing more than the killing
of a leash of fox-cubs? (for whom, to tell the
truth, I felt an unconfessed sympathy). Up on
the downs in fine September weather sixteen years
ago.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is possible that even then, if I was on a well-behaved
horse, I could half forget why we were
there, so pleasant was it to be alive and gazing
around me. But I would be dragged out of my
day-dream by Denis when he shouted to me to
wake up and get round to the far side of the
covert; for on such hill days we often went straight
to one of the big gorses without any formality of
a meet. There were beech woods, too, in the folds
of the downs, and lovely they looked in the mellow
sunshine, with summer’s foliage falling in ever-deepening
drifts among their gnarled and mossy
roots.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What you want is a good, hard, short-legged
horse well up to your weight and able to get
through the mud and do a long day,” remarked
Denis one afternoon in October.</p>

<p class="pindent">We had been out from seven till four, with a
good long spell of digging to finish up with. Having
said this he settled himself in his chair, lit his
pipe, and applied his mind to the Racing Intelligence
in <span class="it">The Sportsman</span> with an air of having
settled the matter once and for all. The sort of
horse he had described was the sort of horse everyone
in the Ringwell country wanted; but Denis
was never afraid of uttering an honest unvarnished
exactitude.</p>

<p class="pindent">I suggested that such a horse might cost more
money than I could conveniently afford.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Put a fiver on Michaelmas Daisy for the Cambridgeshire.
She’s at 100 to 8. I’m having a
tenner on each way myself,” he replied, without
turning his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Although I’d never had more than half a sovereign
on a horse in my life; and that was only at
point-to-points, I risked two pounds ten shillings
each way, and Michaelmas Daisy did it by half a
length.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon afterwards Denis took me to see a dealer
on the other side of the country, and there we found
the very horse I wanted. The dealer (an amusing
Irishman whose deportment I must for once decline
to describe) was anxious to oblige the M.F.H. and
knocked ten pounds off the price. ‘Sunny Jim’
was mine for ninety pounds. He was a short-tailed
corky looking bay with a habit of grinding his
teeth as he jogged along the roads. And that is
really all I intend to say about him, except that he
was well worth the money and approved of by
Dixon as a real old-fashioned sort. I could just
manage fifty pounds out of my own money, so my
fortuitous forty pounds saved the situation. Harkaway
was now transferred to Aunt Evelyn’s dog-cart,
where he conducted himself with dignity and
decorum.</p>

<p class="pindent">The opening meet, therefore, found me prosperous
and complacent, exhibiting my new horse
to the Rev. Colwood, Buzzaway, ‘Gentleman
George,’ and all the rest of my Ringwell friends,
and successfully competing with Stephen and his
brother officers from the barracks. But a couple
of weeks before Christmas the continuity of things
was abruptly fractured by an event which caused
a terrible to-do among the supporters of the Ringwell
Hounds, myself included. Just as we had all
settled down to a record-breaking season, the Master
handed in his resignation. A lawn-meet at
Rapworth Park was rendered positively funereal
by the announcement, and Mr. McCosh, the stolid
purple-faced Hunt secretary, swallowed a stiff
brandy and soda as if a posset of poison was the
sole solution for the blow which had made him so
huffy.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had been a recognized fact that for Denis
Milden the Ringwell country was only a stepping-stone
to higher things. Nobody had hoped that he
would remain with a provincial hunt for ever. But
this was sudden. He had sometimes talked to me
about his prospects of getting a better country, but
he could be as dumb as a post when he had a motive
for silence, and he had given me no inkling of
a change before the morning when he came down
to breakfast with a letter in his hand and informed
me that he’d been elected Master of the Packlestone.
He said it with satisfied sobriety, and I did
my best to seem delighted. Now the Packlestone
Hunt, as I knew well enough, was away up in the
Midlands. And the Midlands, to put it mildly,
were a long step from Butley. So Denis, as I
might have expected, was to be translated to a
region which I couldn’t even visualize. It meant
that he was going out of my existence as completely
as he had entered it. Every time I returned
to the Kennels I found greater difficulty in making
my voice sound convincing while I conjectured
to him about the attractive qualities of his new
country.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime, as if to tantalize the Ringwellites,
the bitches excelled themselves. The only
consolation was that he couldn’t take them with
him. A new Master was secured, but no one felt
much confidence in him or the future. The less
they knew about him the more they shook their
heads over his inevitable fallibilities. Already it
was rumoured that he was the slowest amateur
huntsman in England; and now he was proposing
to hunt the hounds himself two days a week.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I discussed Denis Milden’s departure with
people out hunting they often assumed that I
should be going with him. I replied guardedly
that I hadn’t thought about it yet, although the
truth was that I had thought of little else. I had
to acclimatize myself to the disconsolate idea of
a Ringwell country where I should once again be
reduced to the status of a visiting nonentity. But
one evening when Denis was unusually bright and
communicative (after a good day in the nice bit of
grass country close to the Kennels) he turned his
blunt kindly face in my direction (he was at his
writing-table with a lot of letters to answer), and
remarked: “I’ll have to get you up to Packlestone
somehow. It’s too sad for words to think of leaving
you behind!” When he said that I knew that
he intended me to go with him. And Denis had a
habit of getting his own way.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen Dixon</span> arrived at the Packlestone
Kennels in the middle of October, with my
four hunters and a man under him, he was realizing
an ambition which must often have seemed
unattainable. To break away from Butley for a
season in a country which adjoined such notable
names as the Quorn, the Pytchley, and Mr.
Fernie’s well might he have wondered how it had
been brought about! But there we were; and
Aunt Evelyn had been left to drive through a
lonely winter with Harkaway and the stable-boy—now
nearly eighteen and promoted to the dignity
of wearing Dixon’s top-hat and blue livery coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the moment when Denis had first suggested
my going with him, I had made up my mind
to do it. Nevertheless, the fact remained that I
couldn’t afford it. I was putting myself in a false
position in more ways than one: financially, because
I should be spending my whole year’s income in
less than six months; and socially, because the
people in the Packlestone Hunt quite naturally assumed
that I was much better off than I really
was. I had discussed it all with Denis in April.
Denis was good at making fifteen shillings do the
work of a pound, and he was fond of talking about
money. But when I divulged my exact income he
gravely admitted that the pecuniary problem was
no easy one to solve. He found it a terrible tight
fit himself; it had been costing him over two thousand
a year out of his own pocket to hunt the
Ringwell country, and the Packlestone would be
an even more expensive undertaking. When we
had worked it out on paper—so much a week for
my own keep while living with him in the huntsman’s
house, so much for keep of horses, so much
for my two men’s wages, and so on—the total
came to more than ten pounds a week. And I had
to buy two more horses into the bargain; for, as
he said, I couldn’t have any fun with less than
four, “and it absolutely defeats me how you’re going
to get four days a week even then.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll have one good season, anyhow, whatever
happens afterwards!” I exclaimed. All that I
needed, at that juncture, was a miraculous doubling
of my income.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mental condition of an active young man
who asks nothing more of life than twelve hundred
a year and four days a week with the Packlestone
is perhaps not easy to defend. It looks rather
paltry on paper. That, however, was my own mental
position, and I saw nothing strange in it, although
I was well aware of the sort of things the
family solicitor would be saying if he were permitted
to cast his eye over the half-sheet of paper
on which Denis had figured out my probable expenditure.
Aunt Evelyn, however, cordially approved
my project, and after consultations with
Stephen (who thought it a magnificent effort) and
the delighted Dixon, I bought a couple of horses
in April and May, and then settled down to a
summer of strict economizing. Cricket matches,
at any rate, were an inexpensive occupation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of my new horses one was a bit of a gamble.
He was a very good-looking chestnut who ‘roared
like a bull.’ He had the reputation of being a
wonderful performer, and I bought him, rather
recklessly for forty-three guineas, at the end of a
sale at Tattersalls, after the horse I’d hoped to
buy had gone for double the price I was able to
bid for him. A vet. from the Ringwell country
drew my attention to the handsome chestnut, assuring
me that he’d heard from a safe quarter that
he was a remarkable jumper. Throughout the
summer Dixon and I contemplated him and speculated
on his problematical capabilities (which
proved to be in accordance with the information
given me by the vet.).</p>

<p class="pindent">My other new horse was the result of a chance
ride in a point-to-point. He was a well-bred old
horse, a great stayer, and a very bold jumper.
After I had ridden him in two races, in both of
which he finished strongly, though not fast enough
to win, his owner offered to let me have him for
thirty pounds, admitting that he found him too
much of a handful out hunting. I was already
aware that the old chestnut had a very hard mouth,
but I took him gladly and he carried me well, and
kept my weight down by causing me considerable
exertions by his impetuous behaviour.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Dixon brought the horses up from benighted
Butley I had already been at Packlestone
the best part of a month, riding Denis’s horses out
cub-hunting, getting to know my way about the
country, and becoming acquainted with a few of
the local characters, most of whom were extremely
civil to me on account of my close connection with
their new Master. I did my best to live up to my
too conspicuous position, mainly by saying as little
as possible and looking as knowledgeable as I knew
how. My acclimatization to the new conditions was
made easier by the fact that not many people came
out cubbing before the middle of October. We
clattered out in the misty mornings to disturb the
important fox coverts and the demesnes of influential
personages in the Hunt, and I learned to
recognize the new faces in more or less segregated
instalments.</p>

<p class="pindent">On one occasion we went to a place about twenty
miles from the Kennels, had two days’ routing up
the cubs, and spent two nights in a large country
house. The owner was away, probably at some
German spa: the furniture was draped in dustsheets,
and I remember that we had our dinner in
a little housekeeper’s room. To be there with
Denis and his hounds gave me an agreeable feeling
of having got into a modernized Surtees novel
(though there was little evidence of modernity in
what we did and saw). Less agreeable, I remember,
was our sixteen-mile ride home on a grilling
September afternoon, with the famous Packlestone
dog-hounds, who found the dust and heat rather
more than they could manage after a long morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Life at the Kennels appeared to me almost perfect,
especially when I was sitting with Denis in
the little room in the huntsman’s house and discussing
the new country in all its aspects. My approach
to the country had been uncritical and
eagerly expectant. Once I was settled there I saw
it entirely through the eyes of Denis. If he found
anything amiss I at once assumed that I had already
taken the imperfection into account. For
instance, several of the artificial gorse coverts, he
said, were very thin; and no right-minded fox
would remain in some of the small woods when
once the leaves were off and the vegetation had
died down. I shook my head and agreed that a
lot of the coverts wanted looking after. Several
new gorse coverts ought to be planted in the Friday
country, which was the best part for riding
over. And then there was the wire, which was deplorably
prevalent in places, though well marked
with red boards in the hedges. In the Kennels, too,
there was much to be attended to.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Packlestone country was hunted four days
a week. Its character was varied—cow-pastures
and collieries being the extremes of good and bad.
In some districts there were too many villages, and
there were three or four biggish industrial towns.
This abundance of population seemed to me an intrusion,
and I wished I could clear every mean
modern dwelling out of the hunt. For the most
part, however, it appeared to be a paradise of
jumpable fences, and compared with the well-wooded
Ringwell region it was a tip-top country.
For the first time in my life I was able to sit down
and jump a dozen clean fences without pulling up.
In fact, as Denis said, it was a place where I could
jump myself silly. Also it had the charm of freshness,
and I have always thought that a country
becomes less enjoyable as one gets to know it better;
in a strange country a twisting hunt seems like
a straight one. But this is a truism which applies
to many things in life besides riding to hounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">Foxes were plentiful, except in parts of the
Friday country; but there was no shortage anywhere
as regards rich-flavoured Surteesian figures.
Coming, as I did, from afar, and knowing nothing
of their antecedents and more intimate aspects, I
observed the Packlestone people with peculiar
vividness. I saw them as a little outdoor world of
country characters and I took them all for granted
on their face value. How privileged and unperturbed
they appeared—those dwellers in a sporting
Elysium! Half-conscious of the sense of security
and stability which they inspired, I watched them
and listened to them with a comfortable feeling
that here was something which no political upheaval
could interrupt.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was, however, one discordant element in
life which I vaguely referred to as “those damned
socialists who want to stop us hunting.” Curiously
enough, I didn’t connect socialists with collieries,
though there had been a long coal strike
eighteen months before. Socialists, for me, began
and ended in Hyde Park, which was quite a harmless
place for them to function in. And I assured
Denis that whatever the newspapers might say, the
Germans would never be allowed to attack us.
Officers at the barracks were only an ornament;
war had become an impossibility. I had sometimes
thought with horror of countries where they had
conscription and young men like myself were
forced to serve two years in the army whether they
liked it or not. Two years in the army! I should
have been astonished if I’d been told that socialists
opposed conscription as violently as many fox-hunting
men supported the convention of soldiering.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Packlestone</span> fox-hunters prided themselves
on being hail fellow well met—quite a
happy family, in fact—though a large one, for
there were always between a hundred and a
hundred and fifty riders at a Monday meet. The
Mondays, which were in the middle of the Hunt,
attracted all the regular fellows, whereas on Fridays
there was a cutting and thrusting contingent
from two adjoining hunts, and these people were
rightly regarded as outsiders by the true-blue
Packlestone residents.</p>

<p class="pindent">During my October days new faces continually
added themselves to the covert-side crowd, and by
the time when I began to ride my own horses the
fields were fairly representative, and I very soon
found myself included in the friendliness for which
the Hunt had a reputation, though it was some
time before I could say that I felt at home, especially
when I was on my old chestnut, who fairly
pulled my arms out.</p>

<p class="pindent">On a bright morning late in October, composed
though slightly self-conscious on Cockbird’s back
outside Olton Gorse, I could look around me and
identify the chief supporters of the Hunt. Prominent,
owing to his official capacity, was the Field-Master,
Bertie Hartby, a keen-faced man whose
appointment by Denis had caused a certain amount
of controversy. It was said that Hartby was always
in too much of a hurry, but there he was,
anyhow, intent on doing his best to keep the field
in order.</p>

<p class="pindent">Near him was a highly important personage,
Captain Harry Hinnycraft, who for a vast number
of years had been Honorary Secretary of the Hunt.
‘Dear old Captain Harry,’ as the young ladies
called him (for on them he was wont to turn an
appreciative eye), was by no means an easy old
gentleman to please unless it suited him to be
amiable. His unqualified approval of the new
Master was balanced by an unconcealed prejudice
against his Field-Master, who was, he asserted to
all and sundry, “as wild as a hawk,” varying this
with “mad as a hatter.” Compromise was a word
of which Captain Hinnycraft had never mastered
the meaning; massive and white-moustached on his
magnificent weight-carriers, he had always ridden
about the Packlestone country with the air
of a monarch. He belonged to the old school of
country gentlemen, ruling his estate with semi-benevolent
tyranny and turning his back on all
symptoms of social innovation. Under his domination
the Packlestone country had been looked
after on feudal system lines. His method of dealing
with epistolary complaints from discontented
farmers was to ignore them; in verbal intercourse
he bullied them and sent them about their business
with a good round oath. Such people, he firmly
believed, were put there by Providence to touch
their hats and do as they were told by their betters.
As might be expected, he had conventional
eighteenth-century ideas about what constituted
masculine gallantry and sprightly conversation.
Captain Harry defied all criticism because he was
a complete anachronism. And as such he continued
beyond his eightieth year, until he fell into a fishpond
on his estate and was buried by the parson
whose existence he had spurned by his arrogance.</p>

<p class="pindent">It may well be wondered how the Hunt had
survived the despotism of this old-world grandee,
with whom previous Masters had been obliged to
co-operate (as “best Master we’ve ever had” while
they reigned, and “good riddance of bad rubbish”
when they resigned and left him to find someone to
replace them).</p>

<p class="pindent">An explanation of the continued prosperity of
the Packlestone was largely to be found in Mrs.
Oakfield of Thurrow Park, a lady who made
friends wherever she went. Since her childhood
she had been intimately associated with the Hunt,
for her father had been Master for more than
twenty years. From her large and well-managed
estate she set an example of up-to-date (though
somewhat expensive) farm-management, and
every farmer in the country (except a few stubborn
Radicals) swore by Mrs. Oakfield as the feminine
gender of a jolly good fellow. As a fine judge of
cattle and sheep they respected her; and to this was
added her reputation for boundless generosity.
The Packlestone farmers were proud to see Mrs.
Oakfield riding over their land—as well they
might be, for it was a sight worth going a long way
to see. A fine figure of a woman she was, they all
agreed, as she sailed over the fences in her tall hat
and perfectly fitting black habit with a bunch of
violets in her buttonhole. This brilliant horsewoman
rode over the country in an apparently effortless
manner: always in the first flight, she never
appeared to be competing for her prominent position;
quick and dashing, she was never in a
hurry; allowing for the fact that she was very well
mounted and knew the country by heart, she was
undoubtedly a paragon of natural proficiency.
John Leech would have drawn her with delight.
I admired Mrs. Oakfield enormously; her quickness
to hounds was a revelation to me, and in
addition she was gracious and charming in manner.
Whether she bowed her acknowledgement to a
lifted hat at the meet or cantered easily at an awkward
bit of timber in an otherwise unjumpable
hedge, she possessed the secret of style. Needless
to say, she was the only person in the Hunt who
knew how to manage Captain Harry, who always
spoke of her as “a splendid little woman.” Which
brings me back to my original explanation as to
how the behaviour of that intractable old gentleman
failed to cause as much trouble as one might
have expected.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Captain Hinnycraft lived and bulked big
in the middle of the Monday country, all roads in
the Wednesday district converged on Mrs. Oakfield
at Thurrow Park. Fashionable Friday contained
several good-sized estates and many important
fox-preservers and staunch supporters, but no
predominant personage. Saturday, however, had
its unmistakable magnate in Sir Jocelyn Porteus-Porteous
of Folesford Hall. The Saturday country
was the least popular of the four divisions.
Well-wooded, hilly, and sporadically blemished by
collieries, it was considered very sporting by those
who lived in it. A Saturday hunt was a scrambling,
cramped, hound-musical affair, much enjoyed
by middle-aged enthusiasts on slow horses.
A minor feature which I remember was an abundance
of holly trees, which contributed a cosy
old-fashioned Christmas atmosphere to my impression
of Saturdays. Sunny Jim, my short-tailed,
short-backed, short-legged, clever performer, found
Saturdays much more to his liking than the other
days, with their cut and laid fences, big ditches,
and quick bursts across pasture and arable. I was
very fond of Jim and I always gave him half of
the apple which I produced from my pocket early
in the afternoon. He was an artful old customer,
and sometimes when he heard me munching my
apple he would halt and turn his head to receive
his portion. He did this one day when I was loitering
with a slack rein along one of the spacious
green rides which ventilated the Folesford home
coverts. The august presence of Sir Jocelyn happened
to be just behind me; his amusement at
Sunny Jim’s intelligent behaviour is a lucky little
stroke of reminiscence, for it is not easy to describe
him without seeming a shade discourteous to
Porteus-Porteous. (Note the majestic variation
in spelling.)</p>

<p class="pindent">No one could meet Sir Jocelyn and remain blind
to the fact that he had a pompous manner. And
when he was in the middle of the park at Folesford,
with its chain of woodlands and superabundance
of foxes and pheasants, he seemed just a
little larger than life-size. (He was pardonably
proud of the concordant profusion of those sporting
incompatibles, the fox and the pheasant.) His
ancestral seat (the Porteous family had sat there
since Plantagenet times) was, if I remember
rightly, a Gothic nucleus with Tudor and Jacobean
additions. Unwelcome, from the picturesquely
feudal point of view, were the rows of industrial
habitations which had cropped up outside his
grandiose gateway. These, with the unsightly
colliery chimneys, were a lucrative element in his
existence, since they represented mineral royalties
for the owner of the estate. Nevertheless, his attitude
toward such plebian upstarts was lofty
and impercipient: not having been introduced to
them, he had not the pleasure of their acquaintance,
so to speak. Sir Jocelyn was a short, thickset,
round-legged man with regular features and
a moustache. It would be unfair to accuse him of
looking complacent, for how could any man look
otherwise than comfortable and well satisfied when
he had inherited such an amply endowed existence?
There was hauteur in his manner, but it was not
unkindly, though it was accentuated by his unconscious
habit of punctuating his utterances with
regularly recurrent sniffs. In this connection I
am unable to resist the temptation to reproduce a
memorable remark which he once made to me out
hunting.</p>

<p class="pindent">That winter he gave a ball for the coming-out of
his eldest daughter. (Mrs. Oakfield gave one in
the same week—an intensely exciting week for the
graceful nymphs, dashing sparks, and diamonded
dowagers of the Hunt.)</p>

<p class="pindent">“When did you last give a ball at Folesford,
Sir Jocelyn?” I politely asked him, gazing bashfully
at one of his dangling top-boots.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We have no record [sniff] of any ball at Folesford
[sniff],” was his rejoinder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Why there had never been any balls at Folesford
I am still at a loss to understand. But the fact
remained. It was (sniff) so.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And Sir Jocelyn,
as I have taken trouble to indicate, was the
king of the Saturday country.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>nything</span> like an adequate inventory of
the Packlestone subscribers is beyond the
scope of my narrative—pleasant though it would
be to revive so many estimable and animated
equestrians. Warm-hearted memory creates a
crowded gathering when one has both the dead and
the living to draw upon. I have no doubt that the
Packlestone field (and its similitude elsewhere)
still survives in its main characteristics. Nevertheless,
I adhere protectively to my sense of its
uniqueness as it was when I was a unit in its hurry
of hoofs and covert-side chatter. I can believe
in the present-day existence of intrepid young
ladies, such as were the two Miss Amingtons, who
would have perished rather than see someone else
jump a big fence without having a cut at it themselves
on their game and not over-sound horses.</p>

<p class="pindent">But are there still such veterans as those who
went so well when I was there to watch them?
Grey-bearded Squire Wingfield was over seventy,
but he took the fences as they came and held his
own with many a would-be thruster forty years
younger. And there were two or three contemporaries
of his who got over the country in a way
which I remember with astonishment. Compared
with such anno domini defying old birds, jolly
Judge Burgess (who came from London as often
as his grave duties permitted) was a mere schoolboy.
The Judge had returned to the hunting-field
at the age of fifty, after thirty years’ absence, and
he had evidently made up his mind to enjoy every
minute of it as he bucketed along on a hollow-backed
chestnut who, he affirmed, knew a dashed
sight more about hunting than his learned owner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Regretfully I remember how incapable I was of
appreciating many of the ripe-flavoured characters
whom I encountered with such regularity. Obvious
enough was the newly rich manufacturer who
lived in a gaudy multi-gabled mansion and asked
me, “ ’Ow many ’orses do <span class="it">you</span> reckon to keep?”
as he ambled along on a good-looking and confidential
grey for which he had given a mint of
money. Much more interesting, as I see him now,
was Mr. Jariott, an exquisitely polite silver-haired
gentleman, who lived alone in a shallow-roofed
white-faced house in a discreetly undulating park.
As owner of several good coverts, small and easy
to get away from, he was a punctilious preserver
of foxes. It was said that he knew all his foxes by
name, and mourned the loss when one of them was
killed. But he would have been horrified if his
coverts had been drawn blank, and so far as I could
hear, such a thing had never happened. The cut
of his clothes was soberly stylish and old-fashioned,
and he was shy and sparing in his utterances. I
was told that he bred a certain sort of shooting-dog
and knew more about that breed than any
other man in England. I have an idea that the
dogs were golden brown, silky haired, and elegant.
I was only inside his house once, when the hounds
met there: the interior left an impression of being
only half lived in; I imagined Mr. Jariott as its
attentive but lonely inhabitant, and the windows
looked vacantly out on the pleasant park from the
box-like building.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not far from Mr. Jariott’s house there was a
strip of woodland named Lady Byron’s Covert.
Years afterwards I discovered that the poet had
lived at that house for a short time with that ‘moral
Clytemnestra,’ his wife, who remained there in
her aggrieved seclusion long after his departure
to Italy. My knowledge of this seems to explain
the impression of haunting unhappiness which the
house made on my mind. I should like to know
what old Mr. Jariott thought about it all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Among the younger generation in the Packlestone
Hunt the brothers Peppermore were far the
most conspicuous, as they would have been in any
sporting community. Jack and Charlie Peppermore
were both under twenty-five and had already
broken most of their bones. They were well
known as amateur race-riders. Jack, the younger
of the two, was in temporary retirement from racing,
for he had cracked his skull in a hurdle race
at the end of the previous winter. This did not
prevent him from hunting, and he was usually to
be seen out on some borrowed horse which had
proved itself completely beyond the control of its
owner. Charlie was rather more particular about
what he rode, and was, correspondingly, a more
reticent character. These brothers did and said
pretty well what they pleased in the Packlestone
Hunt; ungovernable as their exploits often were,
they were always forgiven, for they were brilliant
riders and had all the qualities which make
a young man popular in sporting circles. They
were reckless, insolent, unprincipled, and aggressively
competitive; but they were never dull, frequently
amusing, and, when they chose, had
charming manners. In fact, they disarmed criticism,
as do all people whom one cannot help admiring.
And they were the last people in the world
to expect excuses to be made for them. To me, at
that time, they were the epitome of a proficiency
and prestige to which I could not even aspire. As
I remember them now they were desperately fine
specimens of a genuine English traditional type
which has become innocuous since the abolition of
duelling. But if they were to some extent survivals
from a less civilized age, they were also the
most remarkable light-weight sparks I had ever
seen, and as they treated me with amiable tolerance
I considered myself fortunate in knowing them.
Nor have I ever altered that opinion. For in their
peculiar way the Peppermores were first-rate
people, and I felt genuinely sorry when I read in
an evening paper, a year or two ago, that Charlie
Peppermore had fallen at the first fence in the
Grand National when riding the favorite.</p>

<p class="pindent">To say that the brothers were competitive is to
put it mildly. Whenever it was a question of getting
there first, they were absolute demons of
energy, alertness, and pugnacious subtlety. In
the hunting-field, however, they had little opposition
to compete against, and in a fast hunt they
were undefeatable. Denis Milden’s arrival on the
scene of their supremacy reminded them that they
must look to their laurels; but Denis showed no
awareness of the competitive spirit; his only purpose
was to hunt the hounds, and the Peppermores
very soon recognized this and did all they could to
help him. To have aroused their animosity would
have been no joke. Once when I was at a race
meeting I happened to be standing beside Charlie
Peppermore when an inferior amateur rider fell
off, rather ignominiously, at a plain fence in front
of the enclosure. The horse went on alone and the
jockey scrambled to his feet, and as he walked
past us on the other side of the rails Charlie Peppermore
laughed. It was the most insulting, contemptuous
laugh I’d ever heard. Then he turned
to me and drawled, “How I hate that man! I’ve
been waiting years to see him break his neck.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Of the two, Denis liked Jack the best, and one
Saturday in the middle of November Jack was
invited to dinner, with two other young sportsmen
who lived not many miles away. This was an uncommon
event at the Kennels, and Mrs. Timson
rolled up her sleeves and prepared a more than
usually solid repast. When we came in from hunting
Denis got out two bottles of champagne and
some full-bodied port. As a rule we drank water,
and the quantity of champagne and port I had
consumed in my whole life could easily have been
contained in half a dozen bottles of each fluid.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m afraid drink isn’t too good for old Jack
since that accident of his,” remarked Denis, rubbing
his forehead dubiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">He then told the inscrutable Henry to ‘get that
dinner on at eight o’clock’ and went upstairs to
dress—the occasion demanding the special effort
of a dinner jacket.</p>

<p class="pindent">Jack arrived alone in his father’s brougham—a
means of conveyance which seemed vaguely improbable.
Peppermore senior had been a well-known
figure on the Turf, and he still owned a
few steeplechasers which his sons trained and rode.
But he had become heavy and uncommunicative
with middle age, and now devoted himself almost
entirely to looking after his farms and house property
(and putting the brake on his son’s transactions
with bookmakers). Jack was the mainspring
of the party, and his drawling voice kept us all
amused with a continuous flow of chaff and chatter.
I wish I could remember a single word of it, but as
I am unable to do so I can only say that I made
one with the other guests in compliant appreciation
while Denis was an attentive host, and the champagne
promoted conviviality in moderation.</p>

<p class="pindent">After dinner we moved into the other room,
which was even smaller. A decanter of port
quickly became empty, and a certain rowdiness began
to show itself among the company, though
there was nothing to be rowdy about and very little
space to be rowdy in. When Henry brought in
the replenished decanter Jack picked up a small
tumbler and filled it. From his demeanour it appeared
that the competitive spirit was asserting
itself. A few minutes afterwards he threw a chair
across the room and the other young men felt it
incumbent on them to imitate him. He then refilled
his glass with port, standing in the middle of
the room, drank it straight off, and collapsed on
the floor. The little room was overheated by a
roaring fire, and the air was heavy with cigar
smoke. The other two guests were a bad colour,
and I went to the front door to get a breath of the
frosty air.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I returned Denis was looking after the
prostrate Jack; he was, I remember, making a
hissing sound, as if he were grooming a horse, and
I thought what a kind-hearted chap he was. He
told me to go and order Jack’s carriage. I went
to the kitchen, and informed them in subdued tones
that Mr. Peppermore was very drunk. The coachman
grinned and went out to put his horse in.</p>

<p class="pindent">I then became aware that I was very drunk myself,
and soon afterwards Denis gently assisted me
up the steep stairs to my room. I was glad, next
morning, that I hadn’t got to go out hunting. This
was the first occasion on which I was authentically
intoxicated.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>o</span> give a detailed account of my doings during
that winter would be to deviate from my design.
It may be inferred, however, that I enjoyed
myself wholeheartedly and lived in total immunity
from all intellectual effort (a fact which may seem
rather remarkable to those who recognize a modicum
of mental ability in the writing of these
memoirs). For more than six months I perused
nothing except newspapers; my pen was employed
only in a weekly scribble to Aunt Evelyn, and in
copying out hound pedigrees for Denis, who had
discovered that the Packlestone pedigree books had
not been kept with quite that precision which was
proper for such essential registers. In this manner
I acquired an exact knowledge of the ancestries of
Vivian, Villager, Conquest, Cottager, and various
other eloquent veterans whose music had made the
ploughman pause with attentive ear on many a
copse-crowned upland.</p>

<p class="pindent">Odd enough it seems now, that detached and
limited segment of my human experience, when I
was so completely identified with what I was doing
and so oblivious to anything else. Coming in at
the end of a long day, I would find Dixon giving
the horses their evening feed, or brushing the mud
off the horse I had ridden in the morning. Dixon
was entirely in his element now, and he had the
intense satisfaction of going out as my second-horseman.
Dignified and discreet he rode about
with the other grooms, catching an occasional
glimpse of me as I popped over a fence into a lane
or cantered across a field toward a covert. My
broken-winded chestnut had turned out to be a
wonderful hunter; I could trot him up to a high
post-and-rails in absolute assurance that he would
hop over it like a deer, and on such occasions he
made me look a much better rider than I really
was. In spite of all the hard work he had to get
through, Dixon was permanently happy that
winter. He was breathing the same air as the
renowned Peppermores, whose steeplechasing successes
made them heroic in his eyes; and every day
he was within speaking distance of Denis Milden,
for whom he had a corresponding admiration.
When Denis came to my loose-boxes and told
Dixon that the horses were looking fine, Dixon
was more delighted than he knew how to say; and,
of course, as befitted a ‘perfect gentleman’s servant,’
he said almost nothing at all.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was all very pleasant, but when the afternoons
began to lengthen and I had just paid another
bill for forage I was forced to look ahead
and to realize that the end of the winter would find
me in no end of a fix. Fix wasn’t the word for
it as I thought of what Mr. Pennett’s face would
look like when I told him that I was £300 in debt.
‘Out-running the constable’ was the phrase which
would leap to his lips as sure as eggs were eggs.
It was certain that I should be obliged to sell two
of the horses at the end of the season. I couldn’t
afford to keep them even if there had been room
for them all in Aunt Evelyn’s stable, which there
wasn’t (two of them had been put up in the village
in the previous autumn).</p>

<p class="pindent">Faced by the prospect of intensive economy in
the summer and with no apparent hope of another
season in the Midlands, my exodus from the
Kennels meant disconsolate exile from all newly
discovered delights. Even Denis had to admit
this, but he had already more than enough to occupy
his mind. The Packlestone people, too, were
so pleasant to me and so unaware of my inadequate
resources, that I was frequently reminded of my
forlorn future. Quite a number of them would
be going to London for the season, or had houses
there already, and when they hoped to see something
of me in the summer I felt a very passable
imitation of an impostor. Those prosperous and
well-appointed lives had no connection with my
economical future at Butley.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nevertheless, I had visions of Mayfair in June,
and all the well-oiled ingredients of affluence and
social smartness. I saw myself sauntering about
the sunlit streets, well-dressed and acquainted with
plenty of people with large houses in Berkeley,
Grosvenor, of Portman Squares, free to attend
fashionable functions, and liberated from my previous
provincialism. Fantasias of polite society
swept through me in wave on wave of secret snobbishness;
life in London when Hyde Park would
be bright with flowers assumed the enchanting
aspect of a chapter in an elegantly written novel
about people with large incomes and aristocratic
connections. Sighing for such splendours, I knew
that I was only flattening my nose against the
plate-glass window of an expensive florist’s shop.
Orchids were altogether beyond my income. I
never doubted the authenticity of those enjoyments.
My immature mind, as was natural, conjectured
something magical in such allurements of
prosperity. It was the spectacle of vivid life, and
I was young to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">As for the Packlestone people and their London
season—well, it is just possible that they weren’t
quite as brilliant as I imagined. Ascot, ‘Lord’s,’
a few dances and theatres, dull dinner-parties, one
or two visits to the Opera—that was about all.
Since I have grown older I have heard the hollow
echoes in that social apparatus; but at that time I
was only aware that it was an appropriate sequel
to the smoothly moving scene in which I was involved.
It was a contrast, also, to the rigorous
routine of life at the Kennels. All this contributed
to a feeling of finality in my proceedings.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunting season ended with an ironic glory
at the point-to-points, where the inestimable Cockbird
managed to win the Heavy-Weight Race
after Denis had set him an example in the Light
Weights. Everyone agreed that it was a great day
for the Kennels, and a couple of weeks afterwards
I was back at Butley.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had been away from Aunt Evelyn for nearly
seven months. I found it none too easy to tell her
all about my eventful absence from the quiet background
which awaited my return. Everything
was just the same as ever at Butley; and as such
it was inevitable that I found it monotonous.
Sadly I sold my brilliant chestnut for thirty-six
guineas at Tattersalls. He was bought by a Belgian
officer. I couldn’t bring myself to part with
any of the others; neither could I discuss my sporting
future with Dixon, although he was undoubtedly
aware of my difficulties. After an unpalatable
interview with Mr. Pennett I succeeded in extracting
an extra hundred pounds; and so I settled
down to an uneventful summer, restless and inwardly
dissatisfied, unable to make up my mind
what to do next winter, and healthier than I’d ever
been in my life, which (though I wasn’t aware of
it at the time) was saying a good deal from the
physiological point of view.</p>

<p class="pindent">I have said I found everything at Butley unchanged.
This was not so, for faithful Miriam
had retired from domestic service and her manner
of doing so had been consistent with her character.
During the winter Aunt Evelyn had persuaded her
to go to the seaside for a fortnight’s holiday, as
her health had become noticeably bad. While at
the seaside she unobtrusively died of heart failure.
To the last, therefore, she managed to avoid being
a trouble to anyone. This was a severe blow to
Aunt Evelyn. She had been so much a part of the
place that I had taken for granted everything she
did. Now that she was gone I began to regret the
occasions when I had shown her too little consideration.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen Colwood, who was now a well-contented
Artillery subaltern, had stayed for a week with
us at the Kennels, and had departed saying that
the Packlestone country was a fox-hunter’s Paradise
and had spoilt him for anything else.</p>

<p class="pindent">And so my life lumbered on into July, very
much with the same sedate manner of progress
which characterized Homeward’s carrier’s van. I
went to see the Hunt horses sold at Tattersalls, at
the end of May, and there I encountered many of
the friendly Packlestone faces. After that I
avoided London: the mystery and magnificence of
Mayfair remained remote from my callow comprehension
of terrestrial affairs.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>itting</span> in the sunshine one morning early in
September, I ruminated on my five weeks’
service as a trooper in the Yeomanry. Healthier
than I’d ever been before, I sat on the slope of a
meadow a few miles from Canterbury, polishing a
cavalry saddle and wondering how it was that I’d
never learned more about that sort of thing from
Dixon. Below me, somewhere in the horse-lines,
stood Cockbird, picketed to a peg in the ground by
a rope which was already giving him a sore pastern.
Had I been near enough to study his facial expression
I should have seen what I already knew, that
Cockbird definitely disliked being a trooper’s
charger. He was regretting Dixon and resenting
mobilization. He didn’t even belong to me now,
for I had been obliged to sell him to the Government
for a perfunctory fifty pounds, and I was
lucky not to have lost sight of him altogether.
Apart from the fact that for forty-five months he
had been my most prized possession in the world,
he was now my only tangible link with the peaceful
past which had provided us both with a roof over
our heads every night.</p>

<p class="pindent">My present habitation was a bivouac, rigged up
out of a rick-cloth and some posts, which I shared
with eleven other troopers. Outside the bivouac I
sat, with much equipment still uncleaned after our
morning exercises. I had just received a letter,
and it was lying on the grass beside me. It was
from someone at the War Office whom I knew
slightly, it offered me a commission, with the rank
of captain, in the Remount Service. I had also got
yesterday’s <span class="it">Times</span>, which contained a piece of
poetry by Thomas Hardy. “What of the faith and
fire within us, men who march away ere the barncocks
say night is growing gray?” I did not need
Hardy’s ‘Song of the Soldiers’ to warn me that the
Remounts was no place for me. Also the idea of
my being any sort of officer in the Army seemed
absurd. I had already been offered a commission
in my own Yeomanry, but how could I have accepted
it when everybody was saying that the Germans
might land at Dover any day? I was safe
in the Army, and that was all I cared about.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had slipped into the Downfield troop by enlisting
two days before the declaration of war. For
me, so far, the War had been a mounted infantry
picnic in perfect weather. The inaugural excitement
had died down, and I was agreeably relieved
of all sense of personal responsibility. Cockbird’s
welfare was my main anxiety; apart from that, being
in the Army was very much like being back at
school. My incompetence, compared with the relative
efficiency of my associates, was causing me
perturbed and flustered moments. Getting on parade
in time with myself and Cockbird properly
strapped and buckled was ticklish work. But several
of the officers had known me out hunting with
the Ringwell, and my presence in the ranks was
regarded as a bit of a joke, although in my own
mind my duties were no laughing matter and I had
serious aspirations to heroism in the field. Also I
had the advantage of being a better rider than a
good many of the men in my squadron, which to
some extent balanced my ignorance and inefficiency
in other respects.</p>

<p class="pindent">The basis of my life with the ‘jolly Yeo-boys’
was bodily fatigue, complicated by the minor details
of my daily difficulties. There was also the
uncertainty and the feeling of emergency which we
shared with the rest of the world in that rumor-ridden
conjuncture. But my fellow troopers were
kind and helpful, and there was something almost
idyllic about those early weeks of the War. The
flavour and significance of life were around me in
the homely smells of the thriving farm where we
were quartered; my own abounding health responded
zestfully to the outdoor world, to the
apple-scented orchards, and all those fertilities
which the harassed farmer was gathering in while
stupendous events were developing across the
Channel. Never before had I known how much I
had to lose. Never before had I looked at the living
world with any degree of intensity. It seemed
almost as if I had been waiting for this thing to
happen, although my own part in it was so obscure
and submissive.</p>

<p class="pindent">I belonged to what was known as the ‘Service
Squadron,’ which had been formed about three
weeks after mobilization. The Yeomanry, as a
Territorial unit, had not legitimately pledged
themselves for foreign service. It was now incumbent
upon them to volunteer. The squadron commanders
had addressed their mustered men
eloquently on the subject, and those who were willing
to lay down their lives without delay were enrolled
in the Service Squadron which for a few
weeks prided itself on being a <span class="it">corps élite</span> under
specially selected officers. Very soon it became obvious
that everyone would be obliged to go abroad
whether they wanted to or not, and the too-prudent
‘Homeservice’ men were not allowed to forget
their previous prudence.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I sat on the ground with my half-cleaned
saddle and the War Office letter, I felt very much
a man dedicated to death. And to one who had
never heard the hiss of machine-gun bullets there
was nothing imaginatively abhorrent in the notion.
Reality was a long way off; I had still to learn how
to roll my ‘cloak’ neatly on the pommel of my saddle,
and various other elementary things. Nor had
I yet learned how to clean my rifle; I hadn’t even
fired a shot with it. Most of the letters I had received
since enlisting had been bills. But they no
longer mattered. If the War goes on till next
spring, I ruminated, I shall be quite rich. Being
in the Army was economical, at any rate!</p>

<p class="pindent">The bugle blew for twelve o’clock ‘stables,’ and
I went down to the horse-lines to take Cockbird to
the watering trough. Everyone had been talking
about the hundred thousand Russians who were
supposed to have passed through England on their
way to France. Away across the hot midday miles
the bells of Canterbury Cathedral refused to recognize
the existence of a war. It was just a dazzling
early autumn day, and the gaitered farmer came
riding in from his fields on a cob.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I was leading Cockbird back from watering
I passed Nigel Croplady, who was one of the troop
leaders. He stopped to speak to me for a moment,
and asked whether I had heard from Denis Milden
lately; this caused me to feel slightly less <span class="it">déclassé</span>.
Calling the officers ‘sir’ and saluting them still
made me feel silly. But I got on so comfortably
with the other troopers that I couldn’t imagine myself
living in the farmhouse with the officers. The
men in my troop included two or three bank clerks,
several farmers and small tradesmen’s sons, a professional
steeplechase jockey, and the son of the
local M.P. (who had joined at the outbreak of
war). They were all quite young. Discipline was
not rigorous, but their conduct was exemplary. I
soon found out, however, that they were by no
means as efficient as I had expected. The annual
training had been little more than a three weeks’
outing. ‘Solidarity on parade’ was not an impressive
element in the Service Squadron, and squadron
drill was an unsymmetrical affair. Nevertheless,
we talked impressively among ourselves as
though being ordered abroad was only a matter of
weeks or even days, and our officers regaled us
with optimistic news from the Western Front.
Many of us believed that the Russians would occupy
Berlin (and, perhaps, capture the Kaiser)
before Christmas. The newspapers informed us
that German soldiers crucified Belgian babies.
Stories of that kind were taken for granted; to
have disbelieved them would have been unpatriotic.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Aunt Evelyn came over to see me one hot
Sunday afternoon I assured her that we should
soon be going to the Front. Her private feelings
about ‘men who march away’ had to be sacrificed
to my reputability as a cavalryman. She brought
with her some unnecessarily thick shirts and the
news from Butley, where I was, I surmised, regarded
as something of a hero. Enlistment in the
Army had not yet become an inevitability. Everyone
thought it splendid of me to set such an example.
I shared their opinion as we went along
the horse-lines to look at Cockbird. Aunt Evelyn
was bearing up bravely about it all, but it was no
good pretending that the War had brought any
consolations for her, or for Dixon either.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon had taken Cockbird to Downfield the day
after mobilization, and had returned home just in
time to interview some self-important persons who
were motoring about the country requisitioning
horses for the Army. Harkaway had been excused
on grounds of old age, but the other two
had been taken, at forty pounds apiece: the plump
mowing-machine pony was not yet needed for a
European war.</p>

<p class="pindent">When we had finished making a fuss of Cockbird
I took Aunt Evelyn up to inspect our
bivouac; several of my companions were taking
their Sabbath ease in the shade of the rick-cloth;
they scrambled shyly to their feet and Aunt Evelyn
was friendly and gracious to them; but she was a
visible reminder to us of the homes we had left behind
us.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I lay awake after ‘lights-out,’ visual realizations
came to me of the drawing-room at Butley,
and Miriam’s successor bringing in the oil-lamp;
I had not liked it when I was seeing my aunt into
the train at Canterbury—the slow train which took
her home in the evening sunshine through that life-learned
landscape which, we all felt, was now
threatened by barbaric invasion. I had never
thought about her in that way while I was enjoying
myself up at Packlestone, and my sympathetic
feeling for her now was, perhaps, the beginning of
my emancipation from the egotism of youth. I
wished I hadn’t told her that ‘we should probably
be going out quite soon.’ She would be lying
awake and worrying about it now. The ground
was hard under my waterproof sheet, but I was
very soon asleep.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">The cloudless weather of that August and September
need not be dwelt on; it is a hard fact in
history; the spellbound serenity of its hot blue
skies will be in the minds of men as long as they
remember the catastrophic events which were under
way in that autumn when I was raising the dust
on the roads with the Yeomanry. But there was
no tragic element in my own experience, though I
may have seen sadness in the sunshine as the days
advanced toward October and the news from
France went from one extreme to the other with
the retreat and advance of our expeditionary force.</p>

<p class="pindent">I can remember the first time that I was ‘warned
for guard,’ and how I polished up my boots and
buttons for that event. And when, in the middle
of the night, I had been roused up to take my turn
as sentry, I did not doubt that it was essential that
someone in a khaki uniform should stand somewhere
on the outskirts of the byres and barns of
Batt’s Farm. My King and Country expected it
of me. There was, I remember, a low mist lying
on the fields, and I was posted by a gate under a
walnut tree. In the autumn-smelling silence the
village church clanged one o’clock. Shortly afterwards
I heard someone moving in my direction
across the field which I was facing. The significance
of those approaching feet was intensified by
my sentrified nerves. Holding my rifle defensively
(and a loaded rifle, too), I remarked in an unemphatic
voice, “Halt, who goes there?” There was
no reply. Out of the mist and the weeds through
which it was wading emerged the Kentish cow
which I had challenged.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">By the third week in September the nights were
becoming chilly, and we weren’t sorry when we
were moved into the Workhouse, which was quite
near the farm where we had been camping. Sleeping
in the Workhouse seemed luxurious; but it put
an end to the summer holiday atmosphere of the
previous weeks, and there were moments when I
felt less light-hearted than I would have admitted
to myself at the time. Soon afterwards young
Nunburne (the M.P.’s son) was whisked away to
Sandhurst, his father having decided that he would
be more suitably situated as a subaltern in the
Guards. His departure made a difference, but it
did not convince me that as I ought to become an
officer myself, though Cockbird, also, had in a manner
of speaking, accepted a commission.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the daily spectacle of Cockbird’s discomforts
(the most important of which was the enormous
weight of equipment which he had to carry) had
induced me to transfer him to the squadron commander,
who was glad to get hold of such a good-looking
and perfect-mannered charger. Having
got a tolerably comfortable horse in exchange, I
now had the satisfaction of seeing Cockbird moving
easily about with a light-weight on his back
and a properly trained groom to look after him. I
felt proud of him as I watched his elegant and
pampered appearance.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course you’ll be able to buy him back at the
end of the War,” said the squadron commander;
but I knew that I had lost him; it was a step nearer
to bleak realization of what I was in for. Anyhow,
I thought, Dixon would hate to see old Cockbird
being knocked about in the ranks. As for Cockbird,
he didn’t seem to know me since his promotion.</p>

<p class="pindent">It must have been about this time that I began
to be definitely bored with Yeomanry life. It was
now becoming a recognized fact, even in the ranks,
that we were unlikely to be sent to the Front in
our present semi-efficient condition. It was said,
too, that ‘Kitchener had got a down on our Brigade.’
I remember riding home from a Brigade
Field Day one afternoon at the end of September.
My horse had gone lame and I had been given permission
to withdraw from the unconvincing operations.
During three or four leisurely miles back to
the Workhouse I was aware of the intense relief of
being alone and, for those few miles, free. For the
first time since I’d joined the Army with such ardours
I felt homesick. I was riding back to a
Workhouse and the winter lay ahead of me. There
was no hope of sitting by the fire with a book after
a good day’s hunting.</p>

<p class="pindent">I thought of that last cricket match, on August
Bank Holiday, when I was at Hoadley Rectory
playing for the Rector’s eleven against the village,
and how old Colonel Hesmon had patted me on the
back because I’d enlisted on the Saturday before.
Outwardly the match had been normally conducted,
but there was something in the sunshine
which none of us had ever known before that
calamitous Monday. Parson Colwood had two
sons in the service, and his face showed it. I
thought of how I’d said good-bye to Stephen the
next day. He had gone to his Artillery and I had
gone to stay at the hotel in Downfield, where I
waited till the Wednesday morning and then put
on my ill-fitting khaki and went bashfully down to
the Drill Hall to join the Downfield troop. I had
felt a hero when I was lying awake on the floor of
the Town Hall on the first night of the War.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the uncertainty and excitement had dwindled.
And here I was, riding past the park wall
of Lord Kitchener’s country house and wondering
how long this sort of thing was going to last.
Kitchener had told the country that it would be
three years. ‘Three years or the duration’ was
what I had enlisted for. My heart sank to my
boots (which were too wide for my stirrups) as I
thought of those three years of imprisonment and
dreary discomfort. The mellow happy looking
afternoon and the comfortable Kentish landscape
made it worse. It wouldn’t have been so bad if I’d
been doing something definite. But there was
nothing to write home about in this sort of existence.
Raking up horse-dung before breakfast had
ceased to be a new experience. And the jokes and
jollity of my companions had likewise lost freshness.
They were very good chaps, but young Nunburne
had been the only one I could really talk to
about things which used to happen before the War
began. But there was burly Bob Jenner, son of a
big farmer in the Ringwell Hunt; he was in my
section, and had failed to get a commission on account
of his having lost the sight of one eye. What
I should have done without him to talk to I
couldn’t imagine. I had known him out hunting,
so there were a good many simple memories which
we could share.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Escape came unexpectedly. It came about a
week later. My horse was still lame and I had
been going out on the chargers of various men who
had special jobs in the squadron, such as the quartermaster-sergeant.
One fortunate morning the
farrier-sergeant asked me to take his horse out; he
said the horse needed sharpening up. We went
out for some field-work and, as usual, I was detailed
to act as ground scout. My notion of acting
as ground scout was to go several hundred yards
ahead of the troop and look for jumpable fences.
But the ground was still hard and the hedges were
blind with summer vegetation, and when I put the
farrier-sergeant’s horse at a lush-looking obstacle
I failed to observe that there was a strand of wire
in it. He took it at the roots and turned somersault.
My wide boots were firmly wedged in the
stirrups and the clumsy beast rolled all over me.
Two young men, acting as the ‘advance guard’ of
the troop, were close behind me. One of them dismounted
and scrambled hurriedly through the
hedge, while the other shouted to him to ‘shoot the
horse,’ who was now recumbent with one of my legs
under him. My well-meaning rescuer actually succeeded
in extracting my rifle from its ‘bucket,’ but
before he had time to make my position more perilous
by loading it, Bob Jenner arrived, brought him
to his senses with some strong language, and extricated
me, half-stunned and very much crushed.
The same day I was taken to a doctor’s house in
Canterbury. It would be hypocrisy to say that I
was fundamentally distressed about my badly
broken arm. I couldn’t have got a respite from the
Workhouse in any other way. But if I had been
able to look into the future I should have learned
one very sad fact. I had seen the last of my faithful
friend Cockbird.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>taring</span> at my face in a mirror two months
after the accident, I compared my pallid appearance
with the picture of health I used to see in
a small scrap of glass when I was shaving with cold
water in the Army. All my sunburnt health and
hardihood had vanished with my old pair of
breeches (which the nurse who looked after me had
thrown away, saying that they made the room
smell like a stable), but I had still got my skimpy
tunic to remind me that I had signed away my freedom.
Outside the doctor’s house where I was
lodged, another stormy December afternoon was
closing in with torrents of rain. Would it ever stop
raining, I wondered. And would my right arm
ever be rid of this infernal splint? Anyhow, my
December face matched the weather in exactly
the same way as it had done in August and September.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Yeomanry were now in a camp of huts close
to the town. Every Saturday Bob Jenner or one
of the others came to see me; while they were with
me my ardour revived, but when I was alone again
I found it more and more difficult to imagine myself
sharing the discomforts which they described
so light-heartedly. But I had only exchanged one
prison for another, and after reading about the War
in the newspapers for nine weeks, the ‘faith and fire’
within me seemed almost extinguished. My arm
had refused to join up, and I had spent more than
an hour under an anaesthetic while the doctor
screwed a silver plate on to the bone. The fracture
wobbled every time I took a deep breath, and my
arm was very much inflamed. When I was out for
a walk with my arm in a sling I felt a fraud, because
the people I passed naturally assumed that I
had been to the Front. When my squadron commander
came to see me I couldn’t help feeling that
he suspected me of not getting well on purpose. I
still found it impossible to imagine myself as an
officer. It was only half an hour’s walk to the
Yeomanry camp, but I could never get myself to
go up there.</p>

<p class="pindent">The weather had been as depressing as the War
news. Like everybody else I eagerly assimilated
the optimistic reports in the papers about Russian
victories in East Prussia, and so on. ‘The Russian
steam-roller’; how remote that phrase seems now!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Often I prayed that the War would be over
before my arm got well. A few weeks later the
doctor said the bone had united and I had another
operation for the removal of the plate. In the
middle of January I was allowed to return home,
with my arm still in a splint.</p>

<p class="pindent">Since my accident I had received a series of letters
from Stephen, who was with an ammunition
column on the Western Front and apparently in
no immediate danger. He said there wasn’t an
honest jumpable fence in Flanders; his forced
optimism about next year’s opening meet failed to
convince me that he expected the ‘great contest,’ as
he called it, to be over by then. Denis had disappeared
into a cavalry regiment and was still in
England. For him the world had been completely
disintegrated by the War, but he seemed to be
making the best of a bad job.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was five and a half months since I had been
home. I had left Butley without telling anyone
that I had made up my mind to enlist. On that
ominous July 31st I said long and secret goodbyes
to everything and everyone. Late in a sultry
afternoon I said good-bye to the drawing-room.
The sun blinds (with their cords which tapped and
creaked so queerly when there was any wind to
shake them) were drawn down the tall windows;
I was alone in the twilight room, with the glowering
red of sunset peering through the chinks and
casting the shadows of leaves on a fiery patch of
light which rested on the wall by the photograph
of ‘Love and Death.’ So I looked my last and
rode away to the War on my bicycle. Somehow
I knew that it was inevitable, and my one idea was
to be first in the field. In fact, I made quite an
impressive inward emotional experience out of it.
It did not occur to me that everyone else would be
rushing off to enlist next week. My gesture was,
so to speak, an individual one, and I gloried in it.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, although Aunt Evelyn fussed over
me as if I were a real wounded soldier, I was distinctly
conscious of an anti-climax. I had looked
forward to seeing Dixon again, in spite of the sad
state of affairs in the stable. But before I had
been in the house five minutes Aunt Evelyn had
given me some news which took me by surprise.
Dixon had gone away to join the Army Veterinary
Corps. This had happened two days ago. He
was forty-three, but he hadn’t a grey hair, and he
had stated his age as thirty-five. The news had a
bracing effect on me. It wasn’t the first time that
Tom Dixon had given me a quiet hint as to what
was expected of me.</p>

<p class="pindent">The worst of the winter was over and my arm
was mending. Aunt Evelyn talked almost gaily
about my going back to the Yeomanry in the
spring. She had twigged that it was a comparatively
safe location, and I knew from her tone of
voice that she was afraid I might do something
worse. If she had been more subtle and sagacious
she would have urged me to exchange into the Infantry.
As it was she only succeeded in stiffening
my resolve to make no mistake about it this time.
I had made one false start, and as I’d got to go to
the Front, the sooner I went the better. The instinct
of self-preservation, however, made it none
too easy, when I was sitting by the fire of an evening,
or out for a walk on a mild February afternoon;
already there were primroses in the woods,
and where should I be in twelve months’ time, I
wondered. Pushing them up, perhaps! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">But I had struggled through the secret desperations
of that winter, and I like to remember myself
walking over one afternoon to consult Captain
Huxtable about a commission in an infantry regiment.
Captain Huxtable, who had always shown
an almost avuncular concern for my career, had
joined the Army in 1860. He was a brisk,
freckled, God-fearing, cheerful little man, and although
he was now over seventy, he didn’t seem to
have altered in appearance since I was a child. He
was a wonderful man for his age. Chairman of the
local bench, churchwarden, fond of a day’s shooting
with Squire Maundle, comfortably occupied
with a moderate sized farm overlooking the Weald,
he was a pattern of neighbourly qualities, and there
was no one with whom Aunt Evelyn more enjoyed
a good gossip. Time-honoured jokes passed between
them, and his manner toward her was jovial,
spruce, and gallant. He was a neat skater, and his
compact homespun figure seemed to find its most
appropriate setting when the ponds froze and he
was cutting his neat curves on the hard, ringing
surface; his apple-cheeked countenance, too, had a
sort of blithe good humour which seemed in keeping
with the frosty weather. He was a man who
knew a good Stilton cheese and preferred it over-ripe.
His shrewd and watchful eye had stocked
his mind with accurate knowledge of the countryside.
He was, as he said himself, ‘addicted to observing
the habits of a rook,’ and he was also a
keen gardener.</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Huxtable was therefore an epitome of
all that was most pleasant and homely in the countrified
life for which I was proposing to risk my
own. And so, though neither of us was aware of
it, there was a grimly jocular element in the fact
that it was to him that I turned for assistance. It
may be inferred that he had no wish that I should
be killed, and that he would have been glad if he
could have gone to the Front himself, things being
as they were; but he would have regarded it as a
greater tragedy if he had seen me shirking my responsibility.
To him, as to me, the War was
inevitable and justifiable. Courage remained a virtue.
And that exploitation of courage, if I may
be allowed to say a thing so obvious, was the essential
tragedy of the War, which, as everyone now
agrees, was a crime against humanity.</p>

<p class="pindent">Luckily for my peace of mind, I had no such
intuitions when I walked across the fields to Butley
that afternoon, with four o’clock striking in mellow
tones from the grey church tower, the village children
straggling home from school, and the agricultural
serenity of the Weald widespread in the
delicate hazy sunshine. In the tall trees near
Captain Huxtable’s house the rooks were holding
some sort of conference, and it was with a light
heart that I turned in at his gate. It happened
that as I rang the front-door bell an airship droned
its way over the house. Every afternoon that airship
passed over our parish, on its way, so it was
said, to France. The Captain came out now to
watch it from his doorstep, and when it disappeared
he led me into his sanctum and showed me
a careful pencil drawing of it, which he had made
the first time its lustrous body appeared above his
garden. Under the stiff little sketch he had written,
‘airship over our house,’ and the date. It was
his way of ‘putting on record’ a significant event.
Sixteen months afterwards he probably jotted
down some such memorandum as this: ‘Between 11
and 12 this morning, while we were getting in the
last load of hay, I distinctly heard the guns in
France. A very faint thudding noise but quite
continuous as long as it was audible.’ But he
wasn’t able to make a neat pencil drawing of the
intensive preliminary bombardment on the Somme.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> a result of my conversation with Captain
Huxtable he wrote a letter about me to
the Adjutant at the Training Depot of the Royal
Flintshire Fusiliers, which was his old regiment.
As far as he was concerned the Flintshire Fusiliers
were, as he said, ancient history; but the Adjutant
happened to be the nephew of an old brother officer
of his, and he jovially remarked that he would perjure
himself for once in a way by giving me a good
character. For him his old ‘corps’ ranked next below
religion, and to be thus almost actively in touch
with the regiment gave him deep satisfaction.</p>

<p class="pindent">His room contained many objects associated
with his army life; he had seen garrison service in
India; there were mementoes of that; and his little
water-colour foreign sketches which I had often
seen before. His sword, of course, was hanging
on the wall. Everything connected with Captain
Huxtable’s regimental career had suddenly become
significant and stimulating. The Flintshire Fusiliers,
which I had so often heard him speak about
(and had taken so little interest in), had become
something to be lived up to. I would be a credit
to him, I resolved, as I went home across the dark
fields.</p>

<p class="pindent">The local doctor had said I might take the splint
off my arm next day and that was a step in the
right direction. I said nothing to Aunt Evelyn
about my conspiracy with her old friend until a
week later, when I received a favourable letter
from the Adjutant. I was to make a formal application
for a Special Reserve commission. The
Special Reserve was a new name for the old
Militia; a temporary commission in the New Army
would have been much the same, but Captain
Huxtable wanted me to do the thing properly.
Greatly as he admired their spirit, he couldn’t help
looking down a bit on those Kitchener’s Army
battalions.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I broke the news to Aunt Evelyn she said
that of course I was doing the right thing. “But
I do hate you doing it, my dear!” she added.
Should I have to go all the way to Flintshire, she
asked. I said I supposed I should, for the depot
was there.</p>

<p class="pindent">And although I agreed with her that it would
have been nice if I’d been somewhere nearer, I had
a private conviction that I wanted to make my
fresh start among people who knew nothing of me.
Dixon had said (when he brought Cockbird to
Downfield the day after mobilization) that if I had
to be in the ranks I ought to have done it somewhere
where I wasn’t so well known. I found
afterwards that there was a great deal of truth in
his remark. The Yeomanry would have been more
comfortable for me if none of the officers had
known me before I joined. I now felt strongly in
favour of getting right away from my old associations.
Captain Huxtable had given me all I
needed in the way of a send-off. Aunt Evelyn
was helping at the Voluntary Aid Detachment
Hospital, which, as she said, took her mind off
things.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stephen, when I wrote and told him about it,
replied that since I was so keen on getting killed I
might as well do it properly dressed, and gave me
the name of his military tailor, which was a rather
unfortunate one—Craven &amp; Sons. He had been
expecting to get a week’s leave, but it had been
‘stopped owing to the big strafe’ which was imminent;
(the Battle of Neuve Chapelle happened
soon afterwards).</p>

<p class="pindent">Ordering my uniform from Craven &amp; Sons was
quite enjoyable—almost like getting hunting
clothes. Situated in a by-way off Bond Street, the
firm of Craven &amp; Sons had been established a century
ago in the cathedral city of Wintonbury. To
the best of my knowledge the firm was exclusively
military, though there may have been a demure
ecclesiastical connection at the ‘and at Wintonbury’
shop. I was warmly welcomed by a florid gentleman
with a free and easy manner; he might almost
have been a major if he had not been so ostensibly
a tailor. He spoke affectionately of the Flintshire
Fusiliers (‘The Twenty-Fifth’ he called them); he
had ‘been up at the depot only the other day,’ and
he mentioned a few of the first and second battalion
officers by name; one might almost have imagined
that he had played polo with them, so dashing was
his demeanour as he twirled his blond moustache.
This representative of Craven &amp; Sons was like the
royal family; he never forgot a name. He must
have known the Army List from cover to cover,
for he had called on nearly every officers’ mess in
the country during the periodical pilgrimages on
which the prosperity of his firm depended. Newly
gazetted subalterns found themselves unable to resist
his persuasive suggestions, though he may have
met his match in an occasional curmudgeonly
colonel. Mr. Stoving (for that was his name)
chatted his way courageously through the War;
‘business as usual’ was his watchword. Undaunted
by the ever more bloated bulk of the Army List,
he bobbed like a cork on the lethal inundation of
temporary commissions, and when I last saw him,
a few months before the Armistice, he was still outwardly
unconscious of the casualty lists which had
lost (and gained) him such a legion of customers.</p>

<p class="pindent">As soon as he had put me at ease I became as
wax in his hands. He knew my needs so much better
than I did that when I paid a second visit to
try on my tunics, there seemed no reason why he
shouldn’t put me through a little squad drill. But
he only made one reference to the cataclysm of
military training which was in progress, and that
was when I was choosing khaki shirts. “<span class="it">You can’t
have them too dark</span>;” he insisted, when my eye
wandered toward a paler pattern. “We have to
keep those in stock—they’re for the East of course—but
it’s quite impermissible the way some of
these New Army officers dress: really, the Provost-Marshal
ought to put a stop to all these straw-coloured
shirts and ties they’re coming out in.”
He lifted his eyes in horror.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few weeks later (a second lieutenant in appearance
only) I arrived at the training depot of
the ‘Twenty-Fifth.’ The whole concern had recently
migrated from the small peace-time barracks
in Flintshire to a new camp of huts on the outskirts
of Liverpool. On a fine afternoon at the end of
April I got out of the local electric railway at
Clitherland Station. Another evidently new officer
also climbed out of the train, and we shared a cab
up to the camp, with our brand new valises rolling
about on the roof. My companion was far from
orthodox in what he was wearing, and from his
accent I judged him to be a Yorkshireman. His
good-humoured face was surmounted by a cap,
which was as soft as mine was stiff. His shirt and
tie were more yellow than khaki. And his breeches
were of a bright buff tint. His tunic was of the
correct military colour, but it sat uneasily on his
podgy figure. His name, he told me, was Mansfield,
and he made no secret of the fact that he had
chucked up a job worth £800 a year. “And a nice
hope I’ve got of ever getting it back again!” he
added.</p>

<p class="pindent">When our luggage was unloaded we went to report
ourselves at the orderly room. Everything
was quiet and deserted, for the troops were drilling
on a big field a few hundred yards up the road
which went past the camp. We entered the orderly
room. The Adjutant was sitting at a table strewn
with documents. We saluted clumsily, but he did
not look up for a minute or two. When he deigned
to do so his eyes alighted on Mansfield. During a
prolonged scrutiny he adjusted an eyeglass.
Finally he leant back in his chair and exclaimed,
with unreproducable hauteur, “<span class="it">Christ! who’s your
tailor?</span>” This (with a reminder that his hair
wanted cutting) was the regimental recognition
which Mansfield received from his grateful country
for having given up a good job in the woolen industry.
My own reception was in accordance with
the cut of my clothes and my credentials from Captain
Huxtable.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is ten years since I uttered an infantry word
of command: and I am only one of a multitude
of men in whose minds parade ground phraseology
has become as obsolete and derelict as a rusty kettle
in a ditch. So much so that it seems quite illuminating
to mention the fact. ‘At the halt on the left
form platoon’ now sounds to me positively peculiar,
and to read <span class="it">Infantry Training 1914</span> for a few minutes
might be an almost stimulating experience.
Though banished to the backs of our minds, those
automatic utterances can still be recalled; but who
can restore Clitherland Camp and its counterparts
all over the country? Most of them were constructed
on waste land; and to waste land they have
relapsed. I cannot imagine any ex-soldier revisiting
Clitherland in pensive pilgrimage. Apart
from its deadening associations, it was in an unattractive
neighborhood. The district was industrial.
Half a mile away were the chimneys of
Bryant’s Match Factory. Considerably closer was
a hissing and throbbing inferno, which incessantly
concocted the form of high explosive known as
T.N.T.; when the wind was in the east the Camp
got the benefit of the fumes, which caused everyone
to cough. Adjoining the Camp, on the other side,
was a large Roman Catholic cemetery. Frequent
funeral processions cheered up the troops. The
surrounding country, with its stunted dwelling-houses,
dingy trees, disconsolate canal, and flat
rootfields, was correspondingly unlikable.</p>

<p class="pindent">Unrolling my valise in a comfortless hut on that
first afternoon, I was completely cut off from anything
I had done before. Not a soul in the Camp
had ever set eyes on me until to-day. And I was
totally ignorant of all that I had to learn before I
was fit to go to the Front. Fixing up my folding
bed, in which I managed to pinch my finger, I
listened to what this new world had to tell me. A
bugle call was blown—rather out of tune—but
what event it signalized I couldn’t say. An officer’s
servant was whistling cheerfully, probably to
a pair of brown shoes. A door banged and his
army boots thumped hastily along the passage.
Then a sedate tread passed along on the boards,
evidently some senior officer. Silence filled a gap,
and then I heard a dusty rhythm of marching feet;
the troops were returning from the drill-field up the
road. Finally, from the open space behind the
officers’ quarters, a manly young voice shouted, “At
the halt on the left form close column of platoons.”
Clitherland Camp had got through another afternoon
parade. I was in a soldier manufactory, although
I did not see it in that way at the time.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cell-like room was already occupied by one
other officer. He transpired as an unobtrusive ex-civil
engineer—a married man, and expecting to go
to France with the next draft of officers. He was
friendly but uncommunicative; in the evenings,
after mess, he used to sit on his bed playing patience
with a pack of small cards. It must not be
assumed that I found life in the Camp at all grim
and unpleasant. Everything was as aggressively
cheerful and alert as the ginger-haired sergeant-major
who taught the new officers how to form
fours and slope arms, and so on, until they could
drill a company of recruits with rigid assurance.
In May 1915 the recruits were men who had voluntarily
joined up, the average age of the second
lieutenants was twenty-one, and ‘war-weariness’
had not yet been heard of. I was twenty-eight myself,
but I was five years younger in looks, and in
a few days I was one of this outwardly light-hearted
assortment, whose only purpose was to ‘get
sent out’ as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="pindent">The significant aspects of Clitherland as it was
then can now be seen clearly, and they are, I think,
worth reviving. It was a community (if anything
could be called a community under such convulsive
conditions) which contained contrasted elements.
There were the ostensibly permanent senior officers
of the pre-war Special Reserve Battalion (several
of whom had South African War ribbons to make
them more impressive); and there were the young
men whose salutes they received and for whose future
efficiency at the Front they were, supposedly,
responsible. For these younger men there was the
contrast between the Camp and Clitherland (in the
bright summer weather of that year) and the places
they were booked for (such as the Battle of Loos
and the Dardanelles). It was, roughly speaking,
the difference between the presence of life (with
battalion cricket matches and good dinners at the
hotel de luxe in Liverpool) and the prospect of
death: (next winter in the trenches, anyhow). A
minor (social) contrast was provided by the increasingly
numerous batches of Service Battalion
officers, whose arrival to some extent clashed with
the more carefully selected Special Reserve commissions
(like my own) and the public-school boys
who came from the Royal Military College. I
mention this ‘feeling’ because the ‘temporary gentlemen’
(disgusting phrase), whose manners and
accents were liable to criticism by the Adjutant,
usually turned out to be first-rate officers when
they got to the trenches. In justice to the Adjutant
it must be remembered that he was there to
try and make them conform to the Regular ‘officer
and gentleman’ pattern which he exemplified. And
so, while improvised officers came and went, Clitherland
Camp was a sort of raft on which they
waited for the moment of embarkation which
landed them as reinforcements to the still more precarious
communities on the other side of the
Channel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Those who were fortunate enough to return, a
year or two later, would find among a crowd of
fresh faces, the same easygoing Militia majors enjoying
their port placidly at the top of the table.
For, to put it plainly, they weren’t mobile men,
although they had been mobilized for the Great
War. They were the products of peace, and war
had wrenched them away from their favourite
nooks and niches. The Commanding Officer was
a worthy (but somewhat fussy) Breconshire landowner.
He now found himself in charge of 3,000
men and about 100 officers, and was inundated with
documents from the War Office. His second-in-command
was a tall Irishman, who was fond of
snipe shooting. Nature had endowed him with an
impressive military appearance; but he was in
reality the mildest of men. This kind and courteous
gentleman found himself obliged to exist in a
hut on the outskirts of Liverpool for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were several more majors; three of them
had been to the Front, but had remained there only
a few weeks, the difference between a club window
and a dug-out had been too much for them. Anyhow,
here they were, and there was the War, and
to this day I don’t see how things could have been
differently arranged. They appeared to be unimaginative
men, and the Colonel probably took it
as all in the day’s work when he toddled out after
mess on some night when a draft was ‘proceeding
to the Front.’ Out on the Square he would find,
perhaps, 150 men drawn up; discipline would be
none too strict, since most of them had been fortifying
themselves in the canteen. He would make
his stuttering little farewell speech about being a
credit to the regiment; going out to the Big Push
which will end the War; and so on. And then the
local clergyman would exhort them to trust in their
Saviour, to an accompaniment of asides and witticisms
in Welsh.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And now God go with you,” he would conclude,
adding, “I will go with you as far as the station.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And they would march away in the dark singing
to the beat of drums. It wasn’t impressive, but
what else could the Colonel and the clergyman
have said or done? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Young officers were trained by efficient N.C.O.’s;
the senior officers were responsible for company
accounts, kit inspections, and other camp routine,
and the spirit of the regiment, presumably, presided
over us all. I have reason to believe that
Clitherland was one of the most competently managed
camps in the country; high authorities looked
upon it as exemplary.</p>

<p class="pindent">Needless to say, I felt awestruck by my surroundings
as I edged my way shyly into mess on
my first evening. The cheerful crowd of junior
officers sat at two long tables which culminated in
the one across the top, which was occupied by the
impressive permanencies of whom I have been
writing. Old soldiers with South African, China,
and even Ashanti medal ribbons bustled in and out
with plates.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside in the evening light among the subalterns
who waited for the Olympians to emerge
from the ante-room, I had spoken to no one. Next
to me now was a young man who talked too much
and seemed anxious to air his social eligibility.
From the first I felt that there was something amiss
with him. And he was, indeed, one of the most
complete failures I ever came across in the War.
G. Vivian-Simpson had joined the battalion two
or three months before, and for a time he was regarded
as smart and promising. A bit of a
bounder, perhaps, but thoroughly keen and likely
to become competent. He was known among the
young officers as ‘Pardon-me,’ which was his characteristic
utterance. Little by little poor ‘Pardon-me’
was found out by everyone. His social
pretensions were unmasked. (He had been an obscure
bank clerk in Liverpool.) His hyphenated
name became an object of ridicule. His whole
spurious edifice fell to bits. He got into trouble
with the Adjutant for cutting parades and failing
to pass in musketry. In fact, he was found to be
altogether unreliable and a complete cad. For two
and a half years he remained ignominiously at the
Camp. Fresh officers arrived, were fully trained,
and passed away to the trenches. In the meantime
guards had to be provided for for the docks along the
Mersey, and ‘Pardon-me’ was usually in command
of one of these perfunctory little expeditions. He
must have spent some dreary days at the docks,
but it was rumoured that he consoled himself with
amorous adventures. Then, when he least expected
it, he was actually sent to the Front. Luck
was against him; he was introduced to the Ypres
salient at its worst. His end was described to me
as follows: “Poor old ‘Pardon-me’! He was in
charge of some Lewis gunners in an advance post.
He crawled back to Company headquarters to get
his breakfast. You remember what a greedy devil
he was! Well, about an hour after he’d gone back
to his shell-hole, he decided to chance his arm for
another lot of eggs and bacon. A sniper got him
while he was on his way, and so he never got his
second breakfast!”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a sad story, but I make no apology for
dragging it from its decent oblivion. All squalid,
abject, and inglorious elements in war should be
remembered. The intimate mental history of any
man who went to the War would make unheroic
reading. I have half a mind to write my own.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime there is nothing more to be said
about my first night in mess, and the next morning
I began to acquire the alphabet of infantry training.
Mansfield picked it up twice as quick as I
did. For he was a competent man, in spite of his
New Army style of dress. And his ‘word of command’
had fire and ferocity; whereas mine was
much as might have been expected (in spite of my
having acquired a passable ‘view holloa’ during my
fox-hunting life). Learning how to be a second
lieutenant was a relief to my mind. It made the
War seem further away. I hadn’t time to think
about it, and by the end of each day I was too
healthily tired to worry about anything.</p>

<p class="pindent">Life in the officers’ mess was outwardly light-hearted.
Only when news came from our two battalions
in France were we vividly reminded of the
future. Then for a brief while the War came quite
close; mitigated by our experience of what it was
like, it laid a wiry finger on the heart. There was
the battle of Festubert in the middle of May.
That made us think a bit. The first battalion had
been in it and had lost many officers. Those who
were due for the next draft were slightly more
cheerful than was natural. The next thing I knew
about them was that they had gone—half a dozen
of them. I went on afternoon parade, and when I
returned to the hut my fellow occupant had vanished
with all his tackle. But my turn was months
away yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">The following day was a Sunday, and I was
detailed to take a party to church. They were
Baptists and there were seven of them. I marched
them to the Baptist Chapel in Bootle, wondering
what on earth to do when I got them to the door.
Ought I to say, “Up the aisle; quick march?” As
far as I can remember we reverted to civilian
methods and shuffled into the Chapel in our own
time. At the end of the service the bearded minister
came and conversed with me very cordially
and I concealed the fact that it was my first
experience of his religion. Sunday morning in the
Baptist Chapel made the trenches seem very remote.
What possible connection was there?</p>

<p class="pindent">Next day some new officers arrived, and one of
them took the place of the silent civil engineer in
my room. We had the use of the local cricket
ground; I came in that evening feeling peaceful
after batting and bowling at the nets for an
hour. It seemed something to be grateful for—that
the War hadn’t killed cricket yet, and already
it was a relief to be in flannels and out of uniform.
Coming cheerfully into the hut I saw my new companion
for the first time. He had unpacked and
arranged his belongings, and was sitting on his
camp-bed polishing a perfectly new pipe. He
looked up at me. Twilight was falling and there
was only one small window, but even in the half-light
his face surprised me by its candour and
freshness. He had the obvious good looks which
go with fair hair and firm features, but it was the
radiant integrity of his expression which astonished
me. While I was getting ready for dinner we exchanged
a few remarks. His tone of voice was
simple and reassuring, like his appearance. How
does he manage to look like that? I thought; and
for the moment I felt all my age, though the world
had taught me little enough, as I knew then, and
know even better now. His was the bright countenance
of truth; ignorant and undoubting; incapable
of concealment but strong in reticence and
modesty. In fact, he was as good as gold, and
everyone knew it as soon as they knew him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Such was Dick Tiltwood, who had left school six
months before and had since passed through Sandhurst.
He was the son of a parson with a good
family living. Generations of upright country
gentlemen had made Dick Tiltwood what he was,
and he had arrived at manhood in the nick of time
to serve his country in what he naturally assumed
to be a just and glorious war. Everyone told him
so; and when he came to Clitherland Camp he was
a shining epitome of his unembittered generation
which gladly gave itself to the German shells and
machine-guns—more gladly, perhaps, than the
generation which knew how much (or how little,
some would say) it had to lose. Dick made all the
difference to my life at Clitherland. Apart from
his cheerful companionship, which was like perpetual
fine weather, his Sandhurst training enabled
him to help me in mine. Patiently he heard me
while I went through my repetitions of the mechanism
of the rifle. And in company drill, which I
was slow in learning, he was equally helpful.</p>

<p class="pindent">In return for this I talked to him about fox-hunting,
which never failed to interest him. He
had hunted very little, but he regarded it as immensely
important and much of the material of
these memoirs became familiar to him through our
conversations in the hut: I used to read him
Stephen’s letters from the Front, which were long
and full of amusing references to the sport that for
him symbolized everything enjoyable which the
War had interrupted and put an end to. His references
to the War were facetious. “An eight-inch
landed and duly expanded this morning twenty
yards from our mess, which was half-filled with
earth. However, the fourth footman soon cleared
it and my sausage wasn’t even cracked, so I had
quite a good breakfast.” But he admitted that he
was looking forward to “the outbreak of peace,”
and in one letter went so far as to say that he was
“just about as bucked as I should be if I was
booked for a week with the Pytchley and it froze
the whole time.” Dick got to know Stephen quite
well, although he had never seen him, except in a
little photograph I had with me. So we defied the
boredom of life in the Camp, and while the summer
went past us our only fear was that we might
be separated when our turn came to go abroad.
He gave me a sense of security, for his smooth
head was no more perplexed with problems than a
robin redbreast’s; he wound up his watch, brushed
his hair, and said his prayers morning and evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">September arrived, and we were both expecting
to get a week’s leave. (It was known as ‘last
leave.’) One morning Dick came in to the hut
with a telegram which he handed me. It happened
that I was orderly officer that day. Being orderly
officer meant a day of dull perfunctory duties, such
as turning out the guard, inspecting the prisoners
in the guardroom, the cookhouses, the canteen, and
everything else in the Camp. When I opened my
telegram the orderly sergeant was waiting outside
for me; we were due for a tour of the men’s huts
while they were having their midday meal. The
telegram was signed Colwood; it informed me that
Stephen had been killed in action. But the orderly
sergeant was waiting, and away we went walking
briskly, over the grit and gravel. At each hut he
opened the door and shouted “Shun!” The clatter
and chatter ceased and all I had to ask was “Any
complaints?” There were no complaints, and off
we went to the next hut. It was queer to be doing
it, with that dazed feeling and the telegram in my
pocket .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I showed Dick the telegram when I
returned. I had seen Stephen when he was on
leave in the spring, and he had written to me only
a week ago. Reading the Roll of Honour in the
daily paper wasn’t the same thing as this. Looking
at Dick’s blank face I became aware that he
would never see Stephen now, and the meaning of
the telegram became clear to me.</p>

<div><h1 id="ch10"><span style="font-size:larger"><span class="it">Part Ten</span></span><br> AT THE FRONT</h1></div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ick</span> and I were on our way to the first battalion.
The real War, that big bullying
bogey, had stood up and beckoned to us at last, and
now the Base Camp was behind us with its overcrowded
discomforts that were unmitigated by
<span class="it">esprit de corps</span>. Still more remote, the sudden
shock of being uprooted from the Camp at Clitherland,
and the strained twenty-four hours in London
before departure. For the first time in our
lives we had crossed the Channel. We had crossed
it in bright moonlight on a calm sea—Dick and I
sitting together on a tarpaulin cover in the bow of
the boat, which was happily named ‘Victoria.’
Long after midnight we had left Folkestone; had
changed our course in an emergency avoidance of
Boulogne (caused by the sinking of a hospital ship,
we heard afterwards), had stared at Calais harbour,
and seen sleepy French faces in the blear beginnings
of November daylight. There had been
the hiatus of uncertainty at Etaples (four sunless
days of north wind among pine-trees), while we
were waiting to be ‘posted’ to our battalion. And
now, in a soiled fawn-coloured first-class compartment,
we clanked and rumbled along and everything
in the world was behind us.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Victoria Station: Aunt Evelyn’s last, desperately
forced smile; and Dick’s father, Canon Tiltwood,
proud and burly, pacing the platform beside
his slender son and wearing cheeriness like a light
unclerical overcoat, which couldn’t conceal the
gravity of a heart heavy as lead. What did they
say to one another, he and Aunt Evelyn, when the
train had snorted away and left an empty space in
front of them? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">To have finished with farewells; that in itself was
a burden discarded. And now there was nothing
more to worry about. Everything was behind us,
and the first battalion was in front of us.</p>

<p class="pindent">At nine o’clock we were none of us looking over-bright,
for we had paraded with kit at two in the
morning, though the train, in its war-time way,
hadn’t started till three hours later. There we sat,
Dick and I and Mansfield (at last released from
peace-time Army conventions) and Joe Barless (a
gimlet-moustached ex-sergeant-major who was
submitting philosophically to his elevation into
officerdom and spat on the floor at frequent regular
intervals). On our roundabout journey we
stopped at St. Pol and overheard a few distant
bangs—like the slamming of a heavy door, they
sounded. Barless had been out before; had been
hit at the first battle of Ypres; had left a wife and
family behind him; knocked his pipe out and expectorated,
with a grim little jerk of his bullet
head, when he heard the guns. We others looked
to him for guidance now, and he was giving us all
we needed, in his taciturn, matter-of-fact way, until
he got us safely reported with the first battalion.</p>

<p class="pindent">It felt funny to be in France for the first time.
The sober-coloured country all the way from
Etaples had looked lifeless and unattractive, I
thought. But one couldn’t expect much on a
starved grey November morning. A hopeless
hunting country, it looked.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The opening
meet would have been last week if there hadn’t
been this war.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dick was munching chocolate
and reading the <span class="it">Strand Magazine</span>, with its cosy reminder
of London traffic on the cover. I hadn’t
lost sight of him yet, thank goodness. The Adjutant
at Clitherland had sworn to do his best to get
us both sent to the first battalion. But it was probably
an accident that he had succeeded. It was a
lucky beginning, anyhow. What a railway tasting
mouth I’d got! A cup of coffee would be nice,
though French coffee tasted rather nasty, I
thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We got to Bethune by half-past
ten.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">We got to Bethune by half-past ten</span>: I am well
aware that the statement is, in itself, an arid though
an accurate one. And at this crisis in my career I
should surely be ready with something spectacular
and exciting. Nevertheless, I must admit that I
have no such episode to exhibit. The events in my
experience must take their natural course. I distinctly
remember reporting at battalion headquarters
in Bethune. In a large dusky orderly room in—was
it a wine-merchant’s warehouse?—the
Colonel shook hands with me. I observed that he
was wearing dark brown field boots, small in the
leg, and insinuating by every supple contour that
they came from Craxwell. And since the world is
a proverbially small place, there was, I hope, nothing
incredible in the fact that the Colonel was a
distant relative of Colonel Hesmon, and had heard
all about how I won the Colonel’s Cup. It will be
remembered that Colonel Hesmon’s conversational
repertoire was a limited one, so it wasn’t to be
wondered at that my new Commanding Officer
could tell me the name of my horse, or that I was
already well acquainted with <span class="it">his</span> name, which was
Winchell. For the old Colonel had frequently referred
to the exploits of his dashing young relative.</p>

<p class="pindent">I mention this mainly because my first few
minutes with my unit in France transported me
straight back to England and the Ringwell Hunt.
Unfortunately, the migration was entirety mental;
my physical feet took me straight along a <span class="it">pavé</span>
road for about three miles, to Le Hamel, where
my company was in billets. Anyhow, it was to my
advantage that I was already known to Colonel
Winchell as a hunting man. For I always found
that it was a distinct asset, when in close contact
with officers of the Regular Army, to be able to
converse convincingly about hunting. It gave one
an almost unfair advantage in some ways.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mansfield (who had been received with reservations
of cordiality), Dick (<span class="it">persona grata</span> on
account of his having been at Sandhurst, and also
because no one could possibly help liking him at
sight), and I (no comment required) were all
posted to “C” company which was short of officers.
The battalion had lately been much below full
strength, and was now being filled up with drafts.
We had arrived at a good time, for our Division
was about to be withdrawn to a back area for a
long rest. And the Givenchy trenches on the
La Bassée Canal had taken their toll in casualties.
For the time being the Western Front received us
into comparative comfort and domesticity. We
found Captain Barton, the company commander, by
a stove (which was smoking badly) in a small tiled
room on the ground floor of a small house on the
road from Bethune to Festubert. The smoke made
my eyes water, but otherwise things were quite
cheerful. We all slept on the floor, the hardness
and coldness of which may be imagined. But then,
as always, my sleeping-bag (or ‘flea-bag’ as we
called it) was a good friend to me, and we were in
clover compared with the men: (no one who was in
the War need be reminded of that unavoidable
circumstance).</p>

<p class="pindent">Barton (like all the battalion officers except the
C.O., the Second-in-Command, and the quartermaster,
and four or five subalterns from Sandhurst)
was a civilian. He was big, burly, good-natured,
and easygoing; had been at Harrow and,
until the War, had lived a comfortably married life
on an adequate unearned income. He was, in fact,
a man of snug and domesticated habits and his
mere presence (wearing pince-nez) in a front line
trench made one feel that it <span class="it">ought</span>, at any rate, to
be cosy. Such an inherently amicable man as Barton
was a continual reminder of the incongruity of
war with everyday humanity. In the meantime he
was making gallant efforts to behave professionally,
and keep his end up as a company commander.
But that stove had no business to be
making the room uninhabitable with its suffocating
fumes. It really wasn’t fair on a chap like old
Barton, who had always been accustomed to a
bright fire and a really good glass of port.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">So my company received me; and for an infantry
subaltern the huge unhappy mechanism of the
Western Front always narrowed down to the
company he was in. My platoon accepted me
apathetically. It was a diminished and exhausted
little platoon, and its mind was occupied with
anticipations of ‘Divisional Rest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">To revert to my earlier fact, “got to Bethune by
half-past ten,” it may well be asked how I can state
the time of arrival so confidently. My authority is
the diary which I began to keep when I left England.
Yes; I kept a diary, and I intend to quote
from it (though the material which it contains is
meagre). But need this be amplified? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Thursday.</span> Went on working-party, 3 to 10.30
p.m. Marched to Festubert, a ruined village,
shelled to bits. About 4.30, in darkness and rain,
started up half a mile of light-railway lines through
marsh, with sixty men. Then they carried hurdles
up the communication trenches, about three quarters
of a mile, which took two hours. Flares went
up frequently; a few shells, high overhead, and
exploding far behind us. The trenches are very
wet. Finally emerged at a place behind the first- and
second-line trenches, where new trenches (with
‘high-command breastworks’) are being dug.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Saturday.</span> Working-party again. Started
9.45 p.m. in bright moonlight and iron frost. Dug
12—2. Men got soup in ruined house at Festubert,
with the moon shining through matchwood
skeleton rafters. Up behind the trenches, the
frost-bound morasses and ditches and old earthworks
in moonlight, with dusky figures filing across
the open, hobbling to avoid slipping. Home 4.15.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Sunday.</span> Same as Saturday. Dug 12—2.
Very cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Monday.</span> Went with working-party at 3 p.m.
Wet day. Awful mud. Tried to dig, till 7.30, and
came home soaked. Back 9.45. Beastly night for
the men, whose billets are wretched.”</p>

<p class="pindent">I can see myself coming in, that last night, with
Julian Durley, a shy, stolid-faced platoon commander
who had been a clerk in Somerset House.
He took the men’s discomforts very much to heart.
Simple and unassertive, he liked sound literature,
and had a sort of metropolitan turn of humour.
His jokes, when things were going badly, reminded
me of a facetious bus conductor on a wet winter
day. Durley was an inspiration toward selfless
patience. He was an ideal platoon officer, and an
example which I tried to imitate from that night
onward. I need hardly say that he had never
hunted. He could swim like a fish, but no social
status was attached to that.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen I</span> had been with the battalion a week
we moved away from the La Bassée sector at
nine o’clock on a fine bright morning. In spite of
my quite mild experiences there, I felt that I’d
seen more than enough of that part of the country.
Barton and Durley and young Ormand (who was
now second-in-command of the company) were
always talking about the Givenchy trenches and
how their dug-out had been “plastered with trench-mortars
and whizz-bangs.” Now that they were
out of it they seemed to take an almost morbid delight
in remembering their escapes. No one knew
where we were moving to, but the quartermaster
had told Barton that we might be going south.
‘New Army’ battalions were beginning to arrive in
France, and the British line was being extended.</p>

<p class="pindent">On our second day’s march (we had done ten
kilometres to a comfortable billet the first day) we
passed an infantry brigade of Kitchener’s Army.
It was raining; the flat dreary landscape was half-hidden
by mist, and the road was liquid mud. We
had fallen out for a halt when they passed us.
Four after four they came, some of them wearing
the steel basin-helmets which were new to the English
armies then. The helmets gave them a Chinese
look. To tell the truth, their faces looked sullen,
wretched, and brutal as they sweated with their
packs under glistening waterproof capes. Worried
civilian officers on horses, young-looking subalterns
in new rainproof trench-coats; and behind the
trudging column the heavy transport horses plodding
through the sludge, straining at their loads,
and the stolid drivers munching, smoking, grinning,
yelling coarse gibes at one another. It was
the War all right, and they were going in the direction
of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Late that afternoon I walked out a little way
from our billets. In the brooding stillness I
watched the willows and poplars, and the gleaming
dykes which reflected the faint flush of a watery
sunset. A heron sailed slowly away across the
misty flats of ploughed land. Twilight deepened,
and a flicker of star-shells wavered in the sky beyond
Bethune. The sky seemed to sag heavily
over Flanders; it was an oppressive, soul-clogging
country, I thought, as I went back to our company
mess in the squalid village street, to find Dick
polishing his pipe against his nose, Ormand and
Mansfield playing ‘nap,’ and Durley soberly reading
<span class="it">The Cloister and the Hearth</span> in an Everyman
edition. Already we were quite a happy family.
‘Old Man Barton,’ as we called him, had gone out
to invite the Quartermaster to dinner with us.
Until that evening I had only seen the Q.M. from
a distance, but I was already aware that he was the
bedrock of the battalion (as befitted one on whom
we relied for our rations). I saw him clearly for
what he was, on that first evening (though not so
clearly as I can see him now).</p>

<p class="pindent">Joe Dottrell had been quartermaster-sergeant
before the War; he was now Acting Quartermaster,
with the rank of captain, since the real
Q.M. had faded away into a ‘cushy job’ at Army
Headquarters. (He had, in fact, found that haven
before the battalion went into action at the first
battle of Ypres, whence it had emerged with
eighty-five men and one officer—Joe Dottrell.)
Whatever might happen Joe was always there,
and he never failed to get the rations up; no bombardment
could have prevented him doing that.
And what those ‘dixies’ of hot tea signified no one
knows who wasn’t there to wait for them. He was
a small, spare man—a typical ‘old soldier.’ He
had won his D.C.M. in South Africa, and had a
row of ribbons to match his face, which was
weather-beaten and whiskyfied to purple tints
which became blue when the wind was cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">Joe Dottrell now entered, his cap hiding his bald
brow, and his British-warm coat concealing his
medal ribbons, and old man Barton beaming beside
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve brought Dottrell in to jolly you all up,”
he said, with his nervous giggle. “Have a drink,
Joe,” he continued, holding up a squat bottle of
‘Old Vatted Highland.’</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, my lucky lads!” exclaimed Joe, in his
Lancashire voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Accepting the proffered glass he wished us all
‘the best,’ and his presence gave us just that sense
of security which we were in need of. But something
went wrong in the kitchen, and the dinner
was a disgrace. Barton ‘strafed’ the servants until
they were falling over one another, but Dottrell
said the toasted cheese wasn’t too bad, and “There’s
worse things in the world than half-warmed
Maconochie,” he remarked. (Maconochie, it will
be remembered, was a tinned compound of meat
and vegetables; but perhaps it has survived the
War. If so, it has my sympathy.)</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Next day we took it easy. The day after that
we travelled to our destination. I have been looking
at the map. The distance, by a straight line,
was fifty miles. Sixty-five, perhaps, by road; an
easy three hours’ drive for the Divisional General
in his car. Not so easy for the rank and file, whose
experiences of migration were summarized well and
truly by a private soldier, in a simple sentence
which once met my eye while I was censoring the
correspondence of my platoon. “Our company
have been for a bath to-day and had a clean shirt
given us and socks. We had to march five miles
each way, so we had a good walk for it didn’t we?
My feet are minus all the top skin. <span class="it">Everywhere
we go seems such a long way.</span>” In those last words
one infantry private speaks for them all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Our big move to the back area began at six a.m.
We had to be up by then, for our kits had to be
packed and ready by half-past seven. As soon as
we had eaten our bacon and eggs in the stuffy billet
by the light of a candle, the officers’ servants began
to pack up the tin plates and dishes, and I remember
how I went out alone into the first grey of the
morning and up the village street with the cocks
crowing. I walked slowly up to some higher
ground with a view of woods and steeples and colliery
chimneys: rooks were cawing in some tall
trees against the faint colours of a watery daybreak,
and the <span class="it">curé</span> came out of his gate in a garden
wall and said good-morning to me as he passed.
It was Sunday morning, and by eight o’clock there
was a sound of church bells from far and near.
Then a troop of mules and horses clattered along
the road at their morning exercise, some of them
led by turbaned Indians. I sat on a milestone and
watched the sun come out, and a thrush sang a
little way off—the first I’d heard in France. But
solitude was scanty and precious in the Army, and
at half-past ten I was on parade.</p>

<p class="pindent">We marched two miles into Lillers and entrained.
The train started at noon. Ten hours
later we detrained at a station three miles from
Amiens. We had averaged four miles an hour,
and it was now after ten; a dark, still night, with a
little rain at times. Men, transport horses, officers’
chargers, limbers, and field-kitchens (known as
‘the cookers’) were unloaded. All this took two
hours. We had some tea.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If I could taste
that tea out of the dixies now I should write it all
very much as it was. Living spontaneity would be
revived by that tea, the taste of which cannot be
recovered by any effort of memory.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fifteen minutes after midnight we moved off.
It was rumoured that we had only a few miles to
go. On we went to the steady beat of the drums,
halting for ten minutes at the end of each fifty.
After the second halt the road seemed to become
more hilly. About once in an hour we passed
through a dark sleeping village. There was a lamp
hung on a limber in the rear of the column. Twice
I saw our shadows thrown on a white wall in a
village. The first time it was a few colossal heads
with lurching shoulders and slung rifles; and a
second time, on a dead white wall, it was a line of
legs; legs only; huge legs striding away from us as
if jeering at our efforts to keep going. Movement
became mechanical, and I found myself falling
asleep as I walked. The men had the weight of
their packs and equipment to keep them awake!</p>

<p class="pindent">A little after six, just before it began to get
light, we halted for the sixth time in a small town
with a fine church. I sat on the steps at the church
door with Dick beside me. Barton came and told
us that we had another five kilometres to go “up
a high hill.” How we managed it I can’t say, but
an hour afterwards we entered a straggling village
on the wooded uplands. As we hobbled in we were
met by the Quartermaster, who had got there a few
hours ahead of us with the Interpreter (a spindle-shanked
Frenchman with a gentle soul and a large
military moustache—exiled, poor man, from his
jewelery shop at Pau).</p>

<p class="pindent">As we were the first troops who had ever been
billeted in the village, old Joe and Monsieur Perrineau
had been having quite a lively time with the
rustic inhabitants, who had been knocked up out
of their beds and were feeling far from amiable as
regards the Flintshire Fusiliers. Having seen the
men into their ramshackle barns we sorted ourselves
out into our own billets. Dick and I shared
a small room in an empty cottage. My diary informs
me that I slept from eleven till five. We
had marched sixteen miles. It was no easy matter
to move an infantry battalion fifty miles. Let
those who tour the continent in their comfortable
cars remember it and be thankful.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ick</span> and I and Mansfield were starting our
active service with a peaceful interlude which
we had no right to expect. We had ‘struck it
lucky’ as Mansfield remarked. Young Ormand
made round eyes under his dark eyebrows as he
gloated over the difference between Divisional
Rest and those ruddy Givenchy trenches. He was
a sturdy little public-school boy who made no secret
of his desire to avoid appearing in the Roll of
Honour. He wanted life, and he appeared capable
of making good use of it, if allowed the opportunity.
Dick remained silent; he usually kept his
thoughts to himself, confirming other people’s
opinions with one of his brilliant smiles and the
trustful look which he carried in his grey eyes.
Julian Durley, too contented for speech, stretched
his hands toward the blazing wood fire which
crackled cheerfully while the wind blustered comfortably
around the cottage.</p>

<p class="pindent">We were all five of us sitting round the fire in
my billet, which had a good open grate, a few
pieces of old furniture, and a clock which ticked
sedately, as if there were no war on. The owner of
the cottage was with the French army. There
wasn’t a man in the village under forty, and most
of them looked gaffers of seventy. They complained
that the Battalion was burning all their
wood, but firewood was plentiful, since the village
was only half a mile from a small forest, and there
were trees all round it. This, and its rural remoteness,
gave it an air of avoiding conscription. While
we were sitting there, my servant Flook (who had
been a railway signalman in Lancashire) blundered
in at the door with a huge sack of firewood, which
he dropped on the tiled floor with a gasp of relief
and an exclamation, in the war jargon which is so
difficult to remember, which made us all laugh.
He explained that the people had been playing up
hell to the Interpreter, so he’d slipped round to an
adjacent woodstack as soon as it was dark to get
some more of the “stoof” before the trouble began.
Having emptied the sack in a corner he went out
for another cargo.</p>

<p class="pindent">Memories of our eight weeks at Montagne are
blurred, like the war jargon which was around me
then. I remember it by the light of a couple of
ration candles, stuck in bottles; for our evenings
were almost homely, except on the few occasions
when we went out for a couple of hours of night-work.
And even that was quite good fun, especially
when old man Barton dropped his pince-nez
in the middle of a wood. Mansfield’s lurid
language was another source of amusement. By
daylight we were “training for open warfare.”
Colonel Winchell was very much on his toes and
intent on impressing the Brigadier with his keenness
and efficiency. He persistently preached
“open warfare” at us, prophesying a “big advance”
in the spring.</p>

<p class="pindent">So we did outpost schemes at the forest’s edge,
and open-order attacks across wheat-fields and up
the stubbled slopes, while sandy hares galloped
away, and an old shepherd, in a blue frieze cloak
with a pointed hood, watched us from the nook
where he was avoiding the wind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Every evening, at sunset, the battalion fifes and
drums marched down the village street with martial
music to signify that another day was at an end
and the Flintshire Fusiliers in occupation. Ploughmen
with their grey teams drove a last furrow on
the skyline; windmills spun their sails merrily;
rooks came cawing home from the fields; pigeons
circled above farmstead stacks with whistling
sober-hued wings; and the old shepherd drove his
sheep and goats into the village, tootling on a pipe.
Sometimes a rampart of approaching rain would
blot out the distance, but the foreground would be
striped with vivid green, lit with a gleam of sun,
and an arc of iridescence spanned the slate-coloured
cloud. The War was fifty kilometres away, though
we could hear the big guns booming beyond the
horizon.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was happy as I trudged along the lanes in the
column, with my platoon chattering behind me and
everything gilt with the sun’s good humour. Happier
still when I borrowed the little black mare no
one could ride and cantered about the open country
by myself, which I did two or three afternoons a
week. The black mare was well-bred, but had lost
the use of one eye. She had a queer temper, and
had earned an evil reputation by kicking various
officers off or bolting back to the transport lines
with them after going half a mile quite quietly.
She was now used as a pack-pony for carrying
ammunition, but by gentle treatment I gained her
confidence and she soon became a sort of active-service
echo of my old favourites. Dick rode out
with me as often as he could persuade the Transport
Officer to let him have a horse.</p>

<p class="pindent">When riding alone I explored the country rather
absent-mindedly, meditating on the horrors which
I had yet to experience: I was unable to reconcile
that skeleton certainty with the serenities of this
winter landscape—clean-smelling, with larks in the
sky, the rich brown gloom of distant woods, and the
cloud shadows racing over the lit and dappled
levels of that widespread land. And then I would
pass a grey-roofed château, with its many windows
and no face there to watch me pass. Only a bronze
lion guarding the well in the middle of an overgrown
lawn, and the whole place forlorn and deserted.
Once, as I was crossing the main road
from Abbeville to Beauvais, I watched the interminable
column of a French army corps which
was moving southward. For the first time I saw
the famous French field-guns—the ’75’s.’</p>

<p class="pindent">But even then it wasn’t easy to think of dying.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Still less so when Dick was with me, and we
were having an imitation hunt. I used to pretend
to be hunting a pack of hounds, with him as my
whipper-in. Assuming a Denis Milden manner
(Denis was at Rouen with the cavalry and likely
to remain there, in spite of the C.O.’s assumptions
about open warfare), I would go solemnly through
a wood, cheering imaginary hounds. After an
imaginary fox had been found, away we’d scuttle,
looking in vain for a fence to jump, making imaginary
casts after an imaginary check, and losing our
fox when the horses had done enough galloping.
An imaginary kill didn’t appeal to me, somehow.
Once, when I was emerging rapidly from a wood
with loud shouts, I came round a corner and nearly
knocked the Brigadier off his horse. He was
out for a ride with his staff-captain; but no doubt
he approved of my sporting make-believe, and I
didn’t dare to stop for apologies, since the Brigadier
was a very great man. Dick enjoyed these
outings and was much impressed by my hunting
noises. The black mare seemed to enjoy it also.</p>

<p class="pindent">Thus, in those delusive surroundings, I reverted
fictitiously to the jaunts and jollities of peace-time,
fabricating for my young friend a light-hearted
fragment of the sport which he had not lived long
enough to share. It was queer, though, when we
met some of the black-bearded Bengal Lancers
who were quartered in one of the neighbouring villages.
What were they doing among these wooded
ridges with the little roads winding away over the
slopes, toward a low yellow sunset and the nowhere
of life reprieved to live out its allotted span?</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Christmas came—a day of disciplined insobriety—and
the First Battalion entered 1916 in a state
of health and happiness. But it was a hand-to-mouth
happiness, preyed upon by that remote noise
of artillery; and as for health—well, we were all
of us provisionally condemned to death in our own
thoughts, and if anyone had been taken seriously
ill and sent back to ‘Blighty’ he would have been
looked upon as lucky. For anybody who allowed
himself to think things over, the only way out of it
was to try and feel secretly heroic, and to look back
on the old life as pointless and trivial. I used to
persuade myself that I had ‘found peace’ in this
new life. But it was a peace of mind which resulted
from a physically healthy existence combined
with a sense of irresponsibility. There could
be no turning back now; one had to do as one was
told. In an emotional mood I could glory in the
idea of the supreme sacrifice.</p>

<p class="pindent">But where was the glory for the obscure private
who was always in trouble with the platoon sergeant
and got ‘medicine and duty’ when he went
to the medical officer with rheumatism? He had
enlisted ‘for the duration’ and had a young wife at
home. It was all very well for Colonel Winchell
to be lecturing in the village schoolroom on the
offensive spirit, and the spirit of the regiment, but
everyone knew that he was booked for a brigade,
and some said that he’d bought a brigadier’s gold-peaked
cap last time he was on leave.</p>

<p class="pindent">When I instructed my platoon, one or two evenings
a week, I confined myself to asking them
easy questions out of the infantry training manual,
saying that we had got to win the War (and were
certain to), and reading the League Football news
aloud. I hadn’t begun to question the rights and
wrongs of the War then; and if I had, nothing
would have been gained by telling my platoon
about it—apart from the grave breach of discipline
involved in such heart-searchings.</p>

<p class="pindent">Early in the New Year the first gas-masks were
issued. Every morning we practiced putting them
on, transforming ourselves into grotesque goggle-faced
creatures as we tucked the grey flannel under
our tunics in flustered haste. Those masks were
an omen. An old wood-cutter in high leather leggings
watched us curiously, for we were doing our
gas-drill on the fringes of the forest, with its dark
cypresses among the leafless oaks and beeches, and
a faint golden light over all.</p>

<p class="pindent">One Sunday in January I got leave to go into
Amiens. (A rambling train took an hour and a
half to do the eighteen-mile journey.) Dick went
with me. After a good lunch we inspected the
Cathedral, which was a contrast to the life we had
been leading. But it was crowded with sight-seeing
British soldiers: the kilted ‘Jocks’ walked
up and down the nave as if they had conquered
France, and I remember seeing a Japanese officer
flit in with curious eyes. The long capes which
many of the soldiers wore gave them a mediaeval
aspect, insolent and overbearing. But the background
was solemn and beautiful. White columns
soared into lilies of light, and the stained-glass
windows harmonized with the chanting voices and
the satisfying sounds of the organ. I glanced at
Dick and thought what a Galahad he looked (a
Galahad who had got his school colours for cricket).</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in the company mess at Montagne we
found the Quartermaster talking to Barton, who
was looking none too bright, for old Joe seemed to
think that we might be moving back to the Line
any day now.</p>

<p class="pindent">Young Ormand had got his favourite record
going on his little gramophone. That mawkish
popular song haunts me whenever I am remembering
the War in these after-days:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container" style="">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="stanza-outer">
<p class="line0"><span class="it">And when I told them how wonderful you were</span></p>
<p class="line0"><span class="it">They wouldn’t believe me; they wouldn’t believe me;</span></p>
<p class="line0"><span class="it">Your hands, your eyes, your lips, your hair,</span></p>
<p class="line0"><span class="it">Are in a class beyond compare</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="noindent">and so on. His records were few, and all were of
a similar kind. I would have liked to hear a Handel
violin sonata sometimes; there was that one
which Kreisler had played the first time I heard
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And I’d have liked to hear Aunt Evelyn
playing ‘The Harmonious Blacksmith’ on that
Sunday evening when we began to pull ourselves
together for ‘the Line.’ .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In her last letter she
had said how long the winter seemed, in spite of
being so busy at the local hospital. She was longing
for the spring to come again. “Spring helps
one so much in life.” (In the spring, I thought,
the ‘Big Push’ will begin.) Her chief bit of news
was that Dixon was in France. Although he had
enlisted in the Army Veterinary Corps he was now
attached to the Army Service Corps, and was a
sergeant. “He seems quite happy, as he has charge
of a lot of horses,” she wrote. I wondered whether
there was any chance of my seeing him, but it
seemed unlikely. Anyhow, I would try to find
out where he was, as soon as I knew where our division
was going. Dottrell thought we were for the
Somme trenches, which had lately been taken over
from the French.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">But before we left Montagne Colonel Winchell
sent for me and told me to take over the job of
Transport Officer. This was an anti-climax, for it
meant that I shouldn’t go into the trenches. The
late Transport Officer had gone on leave, and now
news had come that he had been transferred to a
reserve battalion in England. Mansfield remarked
that “God seemed to watch over some people.” He
seemed to be watching over me too. Everybody in
“C” company mess expressed magnanimous approval
of my appointment, which was considered
appropriate, on account of my reputation as a fox-hunting
man. I entered on my new duties with
‘new-broom’ energy. And the black mare was now
mine to ride every day. For the time being I remained
with “C” company mess, but when we got
to the Line I should live with Dottrell and the Interpreter.
It was a snug little job which would
have suited Barton down to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was one thing which worried me; I disliked
the idea of Dick going into the front line
while I stayed behind. I said so, and he told me
not to be an old chump. So we had a last ride
round the woods, and the next morning, which was
raw and foggy, we turned our backs on the little
village. The First Battalion never had such a
peaceful eight weeks again for the remainder of
the War.</p>

<p class="pindent">We crossed the Somme at Picquigny: after that
we were in country unknown to us. I rode along
with the rattle and rumble of limber and waggon
wheels, watching the patient dun-coloured column
winding away in front; conscious of what they were
marching to, I felt myself strongly identified with
this queer community, which still contained a few
survivors from the original Expeditionary Force
battalion which had ‘helped to make history’ at
Ypres in October 1914. Most of the old soldiers
were on the strength of the Transport, which numbered
about sixty.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the roll of the Transport were drivers, officers’
grooms, brakesmen, and the men with the
nine pack animals which carried ammunition.
Then there was the transport-sergeant (on whose
efficiency my fate depended), his corporal, and a
farrier-corporal; and those minor specialists, the
shoeing-smith, saddler, carpenter, and cook. Our
conveyances were the G. S. wagon (with an old
driver who took ceaseless pride in his horses and the
shining up of his steel-work), the mess wagon (carrying
officers’ kits, which were strictly limited in
weight), the company cookers (which lurched
cumbersomely along with the men’s dinners stewing
away all the time), the water-cart and a two-wheeled
vehicle known as ‘the Maltese cart’ (which
carried a special cargo connected with the Quartermaster’s
stores and was drawn by an aged pony
named Nobbie). There were also the limbers, carrying
the machine-guns and ammunition.</p>

<p class="pindent">The transport-sergeant was a Herefordshire man
who could easily be visualized as a farmer driving
to market in his gig. The C.O. had told me that
the transport had been getting rather slack and
needed smartening up; but I was already aware
that Dottrell and the transport-sergeant could have
managed quite easily without my enthusiastic support;
they knew the whole business thoroughly, and
all I could do was to keep an eye on the horses,
which were a very moderate assortment, though
they did their work well enough.</p>

<p class="pindent">So far I have said next to nothing about the officers
outside my own company, and there is nothing
to be said about them while they are on their
way to the Line, except that their average age was
about twenty-five, and that I had known the majority
of them at Clitherland. It was a more or
less untried battalion which marched across the
Somme that misty morning. But somehow its
original spirit survived, fortified by those company
sergeant-majors and platoon sergeants whose duties
were so exacting; how much depended on them
only an ex-infantry officer can say for certain;
according to my own experience, everything depended
on them. But the Army was an interdependent
concern, and when the Brigadier met us on
the road Colonel Winchell’s face assumed a different
expression of anxiety from the one which
it wore when he was riding importantly up and
down the column with the Adjutant at his heels.
(The Adjutant, by the way, became a Roman
Catholic priest after the War, and it doesn’t surprise
me that he felt the need for a change of mental
atmosphere.) The Brigadier, in his turn,
became a more or less meek and conciliatory man
when he encountered the Division General. And
so on, up to Field-Marshal French, who was then
reigning at St-Omer (with many a socially eligible
young man to assist him).</p>

<p class="pindent">We went thirteen miles that day. I remember,
soon after we started on the second day, passing the
end of an avenue, at the far end of which there
was an enticing glimpse of an ancient château.
My heart went out to that château: it seemed to
symbolize everything which we were leaving behind
us. But it was a bright morning, and what had I
got to complain, riding cockily along on my one-eyed
mare while Dick was trudging in front of his
platoon? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the third day, having marched thirty-three
miles altogether, we entered Morlancourt, a village
in the strip of undulating landscape between the
Somme and the Ancre rivers. This was our destination
(until the next day, when the troops went
up to the trenches, which were four or five miles
away). It was an ominous day, but the sun shone
and the air felt keen; as we marched down to Morlancourt
a flock of pigeons circled above the roofs
with the light shining through their wings. It was
a village which had not suffered from shell-fire. Its
turn came rather more than two years afterwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">We were all kept busy that afternoon: Barton
and the other company commanders were harassed
by continuous ‘chits’ from battalion H.Q. and, as
young Ormand remarked when he came to leave
his gramophone in my care, “everyone had fairly
got the breeze up.” The only person who showed
no sign of irritability was the Quartermaster, who
continued to chaff M. Perrineau, with whom he
stumped about the village mollifying everyone and
putting difficulties to rights.</p>

<p class="pindent">Late in the evening I was sent off to a hamlet
a mile away to find out (from the billeting officer
of the New Army battalion we were relieving next
day) certain details of routine connected with the
transport of rations to the Line. This billeting
officer recognized me before I remembered who he
was. His name was Regel (which he now pronounced
Regal). I had forgotten his existence
since we were at school together. He now dictated
his methodical information, and when I had finished
scribbling notes about “water-trolley horses,”
“mule-stable just beyond first barricade,” and so
on, we talked for a while about old days.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How’s your cousin Willie?” I asked, for want
of anything else to say. His chubby face looked
embarrassed, and he replied (in a low voice, for
there were two other officers in the room), “He’s
on the other side—in the artillery.” .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">I remembered then that Willie (a very nice boy)
had always gone home to Hanover for the holidays.
And now he might be sending a five-nine
shell over at us for all we, or he, knew. It was
eleven o’clock when I got back to Morlancourt.
Dottrell was having a glass of rum and hot water
before turning in. He had already found out all
the details which I had scribbled in my notebook.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">M</span>orlancourt</span> was tucked away among
the fold of long slopes and bare ridges of
ploughland. Five roads entered the village and
each road, in its friendly convergence with the
others, had its little crop of houses. There was a
church with a slated tower and a gilt vane, round
which birds wheeled and clacked. In the hollow
ground in the middle, where the five roads met,
there was a congregation of farm buildings round
an open space with a pond on one side of it. It
seemed a comfortable village when one looked
down on its red and grey roofs and its drab and
ochre walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">The long lines of the high ground hid the rest
of the world: on the ridge one saw a few straggling
trees, a team of greys ploughing or dredging, and
some horsemen or a hooded farm-cart moving along
the white edge of the skyline. The wind piped
across the open, combing the thorn bushes which
grew under high banks, and soughing in isolated
plane trees and aspens. It was a spacious landscape
of distant objects delicately defined under
an immense sky. The light swept across it in a
noble progress of wind and cloud, and evening
brought it mystery and sadness. At night the
whole region became a dusk of looming slopes with
lights of village and bivouac picked out here and
there, little sparks in the loneliness of time. And
always the guns boomed a few miles away, and the
droning aeroplanes looked down on the white seams
of the reserve trench lines with their tangle of wires
and posts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here, while the battalion began its ‘tours of
trenches’ (six days in and four days out), I had
my meals comfortably with mild M. René Perrineau
and Joe Dottrell. I slept in a canvas hut
close to the transport lines, falling asleep to the
roar and rattle of trench warfare four miles away,
and waking to see, on sunny mornings, the shadows
of birds flitting across my canvas room, and to hear
the whistling of starlings from the fruit trees and
gables of the farm near by. After breakfast I
would sit for a while reading a book by the fire in
Dottrell’s billet, while the soldier cook sang “I want
to go to Michigan” at the top of his voice about
three yards away. But however much he wanted
to go to Michigan, he was lucky not to be in the
trenches, and so was I; and I knew it as I toddled
down to the transport lines to confer with Sergeant
Hoskins about getting some carrots and greenstuff
for the horses and indenting for some new nosebags
and neckpieces for the limber harness. Some
of the horses were looking hide-bound, and I promised
the sergeant that I’d buy a couple of hundred-weight
of linseed for them when I went on leave.
Linseed was a cosy idea; it reminded me of peace-time
conditions.</p>

<p class="pindent">Our serious activities began after lunch. At
half-past two I mounted the black mare, and old
Joe soused himself into the saddle of his pony
Susan (a veteran who had sustained a shrapnel
wound on the near hip at the first battle of Ypres),
and the transport moved off along the Bray road
with the rations for the battalion. As the days
lengthened the expedition started later, for we
couldn’t go beyond Bray until after dusk. It was
a roundabout journey of seven miles, and if we
started at three we were never home before ten.
But home we came, to find Monsieur Perrineau
solacing himself with Ormand’s gramophone: “But
when I told them how wonderful you were” or
“Just a little love, a little kiss”: (Perrineau was
hoping to go on leave soon, and his wife was waiting
for him at Pau).</p>

<p class="pindent">There were times when I felt that I ought to be
somewhere else; I always went up to see my company,
and when they were in the front line I was
reluctant to leave them. One night (during the
second time they were in) I arrived while our batteries
were busily retaliating after a heavy afternoon
bombardment by the Germans. I had some
difficulty in getting up to the front line as the communication
trenches were badly knocked about.
But I found the five “C” company officers none the
worse for having been ‘strafed’ with trench-mortars,
and my visit seemed to cheer them. I came
home across the open country that night (which
saved three miles), and it was a relief to leave it all
behind me—the water-logged trenches, and men
peering grimly at me from under their round helmets:
riding home there was friendly gloom around
me, while the rockets soared beyond the ridge and
the machine-guns rattled out their mirthless laughter.
I left the mare to find her way to the gap in
the reserve trench line: (she never hesitated,
though she had only been up that way once by daylight).
I was seeing the War as a looker-on, it
seemed.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">I had written to Dixon, telling him all about my
new job, and I now received a reply. We were, apparently,
in the same army corps, so he couldn’t be
so very many miles away.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have been wondering, sir,” he wrote, “whether
it might possibly be fixed up for me to exchange
into your battalion as transport-sergeant. You say
your sergeant has been in France since the beginning,
so he’s done his bit all right! It would be
quite like old times for me to be your transport-sergeant.
That was a rotten business about Mr.
Colwood being killed, sir. We shall all miss him
very much when this War is over.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Dixon’s letter sent me off into pleasant imaginings;
to have him near me would make all the difference,
I thought. Everything I had known
before the War seemed to be withering away and
falling to pieces. Denis seldom wrote to me, and
he was trying to get a job on the Staff; but with
Dixon to talk to I should still feel that the past
was holding its own with the War; and I wanted
the past to survive and to begin again; the idea was
like daylight on the other side of this bad weather
in which life and death had come so close to one
another. I couldn’t get used to the idea of Stephen
being dead. And Denis had become so remote that
I seldom remembered him, though I couldn’t say
why it was.</p>

<p class="pindent">So, by the time I was showing Dottrell the letter,
I had made up my mind that Dixon’s exchange was
as good as settled. Joe read the letter through
twice. “Your old groom must be a good sport,” he
remarked pouring himself out a couple of inches of
O.V.H. and adding a similar amount of water.
“But it would take a deal of wangling to work his
exchange. And if you want my private opinion,
young George, he’d far better stay where he is.
We’ll find ourselves in much less cushy places than
this, and you say he’s turned forty-five.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He
handed me the letter. “And you might find yourself
back with “C” company again if we had some
casualties. Things change pretty quick nowadays.
And I don’t mind betting there’ll be a few changes
when Kinjack rolls up to take command of the
battalion!”</p>

<p class="pindent">I nodded wisely. For everyone now knew that
Winchell had got his brigade, and Major Kinjack
was expected (from the Second Battalion) in a
week or two. And Kinjack had a somewhat alarming
reputation as a disciplinarian. He was, according
to Dottrell, who had known him since he
was a subaltern, “a bloody fine soldier but an absolute
pig if you got the wrong side of him.” Old
man Barton was in a twitter about the new C.O.,
his only hope being, he said, that Kinjack would
send him home as incompetent. Barton came in
at this moment, for the battalion had returned from
the trenches the day before.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why, Barton,” exclaimed Dottrell, “you look
as if you’d just come out of quod!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Barton’s hair had been cut by an ex-barber
(servant to the medical officer), who had borrowed
a pair of horse-clippers to supplement his scissors.
Barton giggled and rubbed his cropped cranium.
He said it made him feel more efficient, and began
to chaff Dick (who had come in to ask if he might
go for a ride with me that afternoon) about his
beautifully brushed hair. “Kinjack’ll soon have
the horse-clippers on your track, young man!” he
said. Dick smiled and said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">We arranged to go for a ride, and he went off
to inspect the company’s dinners. When he had
gone Barton remarked that he wished he could get
Dick to take more care of himself up in the Line.
“I sent him out on a short patrol two nights ago,
but he stayed out there nearly an hour and a half
and went right up to the Boche wire.” Old Joe
agreed that he was a rare good lad; no cold feet
about him; the country couldn’t afford to lose many
more like that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">And he got on to his favourite subject—‘The
Classes and the Masses.’ For Joe had been
brought up in the darkest part of Manchester, and
he prided himself on being an old-fashioned socialist.
But his Socialism was complicated by his
fair-minded cognizance of the good qualities of
the best type of the officer class, with whom he had
been in close contact ever since he enlisted. He
clenched a knotted fist. “This war,” he exclaimed
in his husky voice, “is being carried on by the
highest and the lowest in land—the blue-blooded
upper ten and the poor unfortunate people that
some silly bastard called ‘the Submerged Tenth.’
All the others are making what they can out of it
and shirking the dirty work. Selfish hogs! And
the politicians are no better.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right, Joe. That’s the stuff to give ’em!”
said Barton.</p>

<p class="pindent">And they both drank damnation to the (enigmatic)
part of the population which was leaving
all the dirty work to the infantry. Their generalizations,
perhaps, were not altogether fair. There
was quite a lot of blue blood at G.H.Q. and Army
Headquarters. And Mansfield and Durley, to
name only two of our own officers, were undoubtedly
members of ‘the middle class,’ whatever that
may be.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">My ride with Dick was a great success. Over
the rolling uplands and through an occasional strip
of woodland, with the sun shining and big clouds
moving prosperously on a boisterous north-west
wind, we rode to a village six or seven miles away,
and had tea at an unbelievable shop where the cakes
were as good as anything in Amiens. I wouldn’t
like to say how many we ate, but the evening star
shone benevolently down on us from among a drift
of rosy clouds while we were cantering home to
Morlancourt. But about a fortnight later, when
Dick was up in the trenches, I received a letter in
reply to the one I had sent Dixon. Someone informed
me that Sergeant Dixon had died of pneumonia.
Major Kinjack arrived to take command
a day or two afterwards.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ieutenant-Colonel Kinjack</span>
(to give him his new rank) exceeded all our
expectations. He was the personification of military
efficiency. Personal charm was not his strong
point, and he made no pretension to it. He was
aggressive and blatant, but he knew his job, and
for that we respected him and were grateful. His
predecessor had departed in his Brigadier’s cap
without saying good-bye to anyone. For that we
were less grateful; but as Dottrell said, “He’d had
Brigadier on the brain ever since he came back off
leave, and now he’d never be satisfied till he’d got
a Division and another decoration to go with it.”
Dottrell had just got his D.S.O., so he had no
cause to feel jealous, even if he had been capable
of that feeling, which he wasn’t. His only complaint
was that they didn’t make his ‘acting rank’
permanent. He aired that grievance several evenings
a week, especially when he had got back late
with the ration party, and his reference to the ‘permanent’
Quartermaster (at Army Headquarters)
were far from flattering.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Kinjack stopped one night in Morlancourt,
and on the following afternoon I guided
him up to the Line, going by the short cut across
the open country and the half-dug and feebly wired
reserve trench which, we hoped, would never be
utilized. The new C.O. had inspected the Transport
in the morning without active disapproval,
but he was less pleased when our appearance on
the ridge (half a mile behind the front line) attracted
a few shells, none of which exploded near
us. This was considered quite a good joke in the
battalion, and I was often reminded afterwards of
how I’d got Kinjack welcomed with whizz-bangs.</p>

<p class="pindent">“The Boches saw Kinjack coming all right. The
Transport Officer made sure of that!” Barton
would say, with a chuckle.</p>

<p class="pindent">For in spite of my easy job, it was supposed that
I could be a bit of a daredevil if I liked. Not that
I wanted to be, that afternoon; Kinjack frightened
the life out of me, and was so sceptical of my
ability to find the way that I began to feel none too
sure about it myself.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It is, however, just conceivable
that at that time I didn’t care what happened
to the new Colonel or anybody else.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">That same day, at about midnight, I was awakened
by Dottrell, who told me that I was to go
on leave next morning. I drove to the station in
the Maltese cart; the train started at 9.30, crawled
to Havre, and by ten o’clock next day I was in
London. I had been in France less than four
months. As regards war experience I felt a bit
of an impostor. I had noticed that officers back
from their ten days’ leave were usually somewhat
silent about it. Then, after a few weeks, they
began to look forward to their next leave again,
and to talk about this future fact. But there
wasn’t much to be said about mine, for it was bitterly
cold and a heavy fall of snow knocked my
hopes of hunting on the head. So I remained
quietly with Aunt Evelyn at Butley, telling myself
that it was a great luxury to have a hot bath
every day, and waiting for a thaw. If it thawed
I should have two or three days with the Ringwell
on Colonel Hesmon’s horses. And I should stay
at Hoadley Rectory. But no thaw came, and I
returned to France without having been to the Rectory,
which had been a painful idea, in any case.
The Rector evidently felt the same, for he wrote
me a sad letter in which he said “as I think of all
the suffering and death, the anxieties and bereavements
of this terrible struggle, I feel that in our
ignorance we can only rest on the words, ‘What
I do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know
hereafter.’ Obedience and self-sacrifice for right
and truth in spite of suffering and death is Christianity.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
I received this letter on my last
day at Butley. Sitting alone in the schoolroom late
at night, I felt touched by the goodness and patience
of my old friend, but I was unable to accept
his words in the right spirit. He spoke too soon.
I was too young to understand. And England
wasn’t what it used to be. I had been over to say
good-bye to Captain Huxtable that afternoon; but
the War was making an old man of him, though
he did his best to be bright. And kind Aunt Evelyn
talked bitterly about the Germans and called
them ‘hell-hounds.’ I found myself defending
them, although I couldn’t claim acquaintance with
a single one of them (except Willie Regel, and I
shouldn’t have known him by sight if I’d met him).</p>

<p class="pindent">Looking round the room at the enlarged photographs
of my hunters, I began to realize that my
past was wearing a bit thin. The War seemed to
have made up its mind to obliterate all those early
adventures of mine. Point-to-point cups shone,
but without conviction. And Dixon was dead.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps, after all, it was better to be back with
the battalion. The only way to forget about the
War was to be on the other side of the Channel.
But the fire burnt brightly and the kettle was hissing
on the hob. It was nice to be wearing my old
civilian clothes, and to make myself a cup of tea.
Old Joe will be on his way home with the transport
now, I thought, contrasting my comfort with him
joggling along the Bray road in this awful weather.
His bronchitis had been bad lately, too. Dick was
a thought which I repressed. He would be getting
his leave soon, anyhow.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The Rector said we
were fighting for right and truth; but it was no use
trying to think it all out now. There were those
things to take back for the others—a bottle of old
brandy for Dottrell and some smoked salmon for
“C” company mess—I mustn’t make any mistake
about that when I get to town in the morning, I
thought.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the next evening I was on the boat at Southampton;
the weather had turned mild again; it was
a quiet evening; I watched the red and green lights
across the harbour, and listened to the creaking
cries of the gulls, like the sound of windlasses and
pulleys, as they swooped in circles or settled on the
smooth dusk of the water. From the town came
the note of a bugle, a remote call, like the last
thought of home. And then we were churning
across the dark sea, to find France still under snow.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a continuous rumble and grumble of
bombardment while we were going up with the
rations on the day after I got back from leave. As
we came over the hill beyond Bray the darkness
toward Albert was lit with the glare of explosions
that blinked and bumped. Dottrell remarked that
there seemed to be a bit of a mix-up, which was his
way of saying that he didn’t altogether like the
look of things that evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">When we arrived at the ration dump the quartermaster-sergeant
told us that the battalion had been
standing-to for the past two hours. It was possible
that the Boches might be coming across. “C”
company was in the front line. The noise was subsiding,
so I went up there, leaving Joe to pay his
nightly call at battalion headquarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stumbling and splashing up a communication
trench known as Canterbury Avenue, with the parcel
of smoked salmon stuffed into my haversack, I
felt that smoked salmon wasn’t much of an antidote
for people who had been putting up with all that
shell-fire. Still, it was something.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Round
the next corner I had to flatten myself against the
wall of that wet ditch, for someone was being carried
down on a stretcher. An extra stretcher-bearer
walking behind told me it was Corporal
Price of “C” company. “A rifle-grenade got him
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. looks as if he’s a goner.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” His face was
only a blur of white in the gloom; then, with the
drumming of their boots on the trenchboards, Corporal
Price left the War behind him. I remembered
him vaguely as a quiet little man in Durley’s
platoon. No use offering <span class="it">him</span> smoked salmon, I
thought, as I came to the top of Canterbury Avenue,
and, as usual, lost my way in the maze of saps
and small trenches behind the front line. Watling
Street was the one I wanted. Finding one’s way
about the trenches in the dark was no easy job
when one didn’t live up there. I passed the dugouts
of the support company at Maple Redoubt.
Candles and braziers glinted through the curtain-flaps
and voices muttered gruffly from the little underground
cabins (which would have been safer if
they had been deeper down in the earth). Now
and again there was the splitting crack of a rifle-shot
from the other side, or a five-nine shell droned
serenely across the upper air to burst with a hollow
bang; voluminous reverberations rolled along the
valley. The shallow blanching flare of a rocket
gave me a glimpse of the mounds of bleached sandbags
on the Redoubt. Its brief whiteness died
downward, leaving a dark world; chilly gusts met
me at corners, piping drearily through crannies of
the parapet; very different was the voice of the
wind that sang in the cedar tree in the garden at
home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pushing past the gas-blanket, I blundered down
the stairs to the company headquarters’ dug-out.
There were twenty steps to that earthly smelling
den, with its thick wooden props down the middle
and its precarious yellow candlelight casting wobbling
shadows. Barton was sitting on a box at the
rough table, with a tin mug and a half-empty
whisky bottle. His shoulders were hunched and
the collar of his trench-coat was turned up to his
ears. Dick was in deep shadow, lying on a bunk
(made of wire-netting with empty sandbags on it).
It was a morose cramped little scene, loathsome to
live in as it is hateful to remember. The air was
dank and musty; lumps of chalk fell from the ‘ceiling’
at intervals. There was a bad smell of burnt
grease, and the frizzle of something frying in the
adjoining kennel that was called the kitchen was
the only evidence of ordinary civilization—that and
Barton’s shining pince-nez, and the maps and notebooks
which were on the table.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Smoked salmon from Piccadilly Circus was
something after all. It cheered Barton immensely.
He unpacked it; he sniffed it; and no doubt it
brought the lights of London into his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Gosh, if only this war would stop!” he exclaimed.
“I’d be off to Scott’s oyster-bar like a
streak of light and you’d never get me away from
it again!”</p>

<p class="pindent">He held the smoked salmon under Dick’s nose
and told him what a lucky young devil he was to be
going on leave in two or three days’ time. Dick
wasn’t as bright as usual; he’d got a rotten headache,
he said. Barton told him he’d better let Ormand
go out with the wiring-party instead of him.
But he said no, he’d be all right by then, and Ormand
had been out last night. Barton told me
they’d had a lively time with the C.O. lately: “He
gave orders for the whole of the front line to be rewired;
we’ve been at it every night, but he came up
this morning with his big periscope, strafing like
hell about the gaps along by the mine-craters. He
says the wire isn’t strong enough to stop a wheelbarrow—why
a wheelbarrow God knows!” He
laughed, rather hysterically; his nerves were on
edge, and no wonder.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For, as he said, what
with the muck everything was in since the snow
melted, and being chivvied by Kinjack, and then
being ‘crumped’ all the afternoon, life hadn’t been
worth living lately. The odd thing was that good
old Barton seemed equally concerned because the
snowy weather had prevented me from having any
hunting while on leave. And Dick agreed that it
had been very rough on me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mansfield and Ormand came in at that moment;
these two were very good friends, and they always
seemed to be cheering one another up. They had
left Durley on duty in the front trench. They
wanted to hear all about the ‘shows’ I had been to
in London, but I couldn’t tell them anything
(though I wished I could), for I hadn’t been to a
theatre, and it was no use talking about the Symphony
Concert at Queen’s Hall, which now made
me feel rather a prig.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dick was still lying in his dark corner when I
said good-night and groped my way up the steps,
leaving them to make the most of the smoked salmon.
Going down Canterbury Avenue it was so
pitch black that I couldn’t see my own hand; once
or twice a flare went up in the spectral region on
the shoulder of the hill behind me; lit by that unearthly
glare the darkness became desolation.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Coming up from the transport lines at twelve
o’clock next morning I found Joe Dottrell standing
outside the Quartermaster’s stores. His face
warned me to expect bad news. No news could
have been worse. Dick had been killed. He had
been hit in the throat by a rifle bullet while out
with the wiring-party, and had died at the dressing-station
a few hours afterwards. The battalion
doctor had been a throat specialist before the War,
but this had not been enough.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sky was angry with a red smoky sunset
when we rode up with the rations. Later on, when
it was dark, we stood on the bare slope just above
the ration dump while the Brigade chaplain went
through his words; a flag covered all that we were
there for; only the white stripes on the flag made
any impression on the dimness of the night. Once
the chaplain’s words were obliterated by a prolonged
burst of machine-gun fire; when he had
finished, a trench-mortar ‘cannister’ fell a few hundred
yards away, spouting the earth up with a
crash.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A sack was lowered in the hole in the
ground. The sack was Dick. I knew Death then.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">A few days later, when the battalion was back at
Morlancourt, and Kinjack was having a look
round the Transport lines, he remarked that he
wasn’t sure that I wasn’t rather wasted as Transport
Officer. “I’d much rather be with ‘C’ Company,
sir.” Some sort of anger surged up inside
me as I said it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He agreed. No doubt he
had intended me to return to my platoon.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">E</span>aster</span> was late in April that year; my first
three tours of trenches occupied me during
the last thirty days of Lent. This essential season
in the Church calendar was not, as far as I remember,
remarked upon by anyone in my company, although
the name of Christ was often on our lips,
and Mansfield (when a cannister made a mess of
the trench not many yards away from him) was
even heard to refer to our Saviour as “murry old
Jesus!” These innocuous blasphemings of the holy
name were a peculiar feature of the War, in which
the principles of Christianity were either obliterated
or falsified for the convenience of all who were
engaged in it. Up in the trenches every man bore
his own burden; the Sabbath was not made for
man; and if a man laid down his life for his friends
it was no part of his military duties. To kill an
enemy was an effective action; to bring in one of
own wounded was praise-worthy, but unrelated to
our war-aims. The Brigade chaplain did not exhort
us to love our enemies. He was content to
lead off with the hymn “How sweet the name of
Jesus sounds!”</p>

<p class="pindent">I mention this war-time dilemma of the Churches
because my own mind was in rather a muddle at
that time. I went up to the trenches with the intention
of trying to kill someone. It was my idea
of getting a bit of my own back. I did not say
anything about it to anyone; but it was this feeling
which took me out patrolling the mine-craters
whenever an opportunity offered itself. It was a
phase in my war experience—no more irrational
than the rest of the proceedings, I suppose; it was
an outburst of blind bravado which now seems paltry
when I compare it with the behaviour of an
officer like Julian Durley, who did everything that
was asked of him as a matter of course.</p>

<p class="pindent">Lent, as I have said before, was not observed by
us. But Barton got somewhere near observing it
one evening. We had just returned to our dug-out
after the twilight ritual of ‘standing-to.’ The rations
had come up, and with them the mail. After
reading a letter from his wife he looked at me and
said: “O Kangar, how I wish I were a cathedral
organist!” (I was known as ‘the Kangaroo’ in “C”
company.) His remark, which had no connection
with any religious feeling, led us on to pleasant
reminiscences of cathedral closes. Nothing would
be nicer, we thought, than to be sauntering back,
after Evensong, to one of those snug old houses,
with a book of anthems under our arms—preferably
on a mild evening toward the end of October.
(In his civilian days Barton had attended race
meetings regularly; his musical experience had
been confined to musical comedy.)</p>

<p class="pindent">The mail that evening had brought me a parcel
from Aunt Evelyn, which contained two pots of
specially good jam. Ration jam was usually in
tins, and of tins it tasted. Barton gazed affectionately
at the coloured label, which represented
a cherry-growing landscape. The label was a talisman
which carried his mind safely to the home
counties of England. He spoke of railway travelling.
“Do you remember the five-thirty from Paddington?
What a dear old train it was!” Helping
himself to a spoonful of cherry jam he mentally
passed through Maidenhead in a Pullman carriage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
mail had also brought me the balance
sheet of the Ringwell Hunt. These Hunt
accounts made me feel homesick. And it appeared
that the late Mr. S. Colwood had subscribed ten
pounds. He must have sent it early in September,
just before he was killed. No doubt he wrote the
cheque in a day-dream about hunting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the meantime we were down in that frowsty
smelling dug-out, listening to the cautious nibbling
of rats behind the wooden walls; and above ground
there was the muffled boom of something bursting.
And two more officers had been killed. Not in our
company though. The Germans had put up another
mine that afternoon without doing us any
damage. Their trenches were only a hundred and
fifty yards from ours; in some places less than fifty.
It was a sector of the line which specialized in
mines; more than half of our 750 yard frontage was
pitted with mine-craters, some of them fifty feet
deep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They were digging in front of Bois Francais
Trench again last night,” I remarked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Barton had just received a message from battalion
headquarters saying that the company front
was to be thoroughly patrolled.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll take O’Brien out with me to-night,” I
added.</p>

<p class="pindent">Barton’s ruddy face had resumed the worried
expression which it wore when messages came from
Kinjack or the Adjutant.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, Kangar; but do be careful. It puts
the fear of God into me when you’re out there and
I’m waiting for you to come in.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It put the fear of God into me too, but it was
the only escape into freedom which I could contrive,
up in those trenches opposite Fricourt and
Mametz. And I was angry with the War.</p>

<p class="pindent">Memory eliminates the realities of bodily discomfort
which made the texture of trench-life what
it was. Mental activity was clogged and hindered
by gross physical actualities. It was these details
of discomfort which constituted the humanity of
an infantryman’s existence. Being in the trenches
meant among other things having a ‘trench-mouth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I can see myself sitting in the sun in a nook
among the sandbags and chalky debris behind the
support line. There is a strong smell of chloride
of lime. I am scraping the caked mud off my wire-torn
puttees with a rusty entrenching tool. Last
night I was out patrolling with Private O’Brien,
who used to be a dock labourer at Cardiff. We
threw a few Mills bombs at a German working-party
who were putting up some wire and had no
wish to do us any harm. Probably I am feeling
pleased with myself about this. Now and again
a leisurely five-nine shell passes overhead in the
blue air where the larks are singing. The sound of
the shell is like water trickling into a can. The
curve of its trajectory sounds peaceful until the
culminating crash. A little weasel runs past my
outstretched feet, glancing at me with tiny bright
eyes, apparently unafraid. One of our shrapnel
shells, whizzing over to the enemy lines, bursts with
a hollow crash. Against the clear morning sky a
cloud of dark smoke expands and drifts away.
Slowly its dingy wrestling vapours take the form
of a hooded giant with clumsy expostulating arms.
Then, with a gradual gesture of acquiescence, it
lolls sideways, falling over into the attitude of a
swimmer on his side. And so it dissolves into nothingness.
Perhaps the shell has killed someone.
Whether it has or whether it hasn’t, I continue to
scrape my puttees, and the weasel goes about his
business. The sun strikes the glinting wings of an
aeroplane, forging away westward. Somewhere
on the slope behind me a partridge makes its unmilitary
noise—down there where Dick was buried
a few weeks ago. Dick’s father was a very good
man with a gun, so Dick used to say.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Down in the reserve line I was sitting in the
gloom of the steel hut (like being inside a boiler)
reading a novel by candlelight while Barton and
Mansfield snored on their beds and my servant
Flook sang ‘Dixieland’ in some adjoining cubby-hole.
Being in reserve was a sluggish business; in
the front line we were much less morose. Outside
there was a remote rumble going on, like heavy furniture
being moved about in a room overhead. But
the little wooden weather-vane on the roof kept on
spinning and rattling as though nothing were amiss
with the world. Then the patter of rain began, and
I shivered and turned chilly and thought of home
and safety. It was time to be going up with that
working-party. We should be out from eight till
midnight, piling sandbags on the parapet of the
front line trench, which had suffered from the wet
weather.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a pitch dark night. As we were going up
across the open to the support line the bombardment,
about two miles away in the low country on
our left reached a climax. The sky winked and
flickered like a thunderstorm gone crazy. It was
a battle seen in miniature against a screen of blackness.
Rocketlights, red and white, curved upward;
in the rapid glare of bursting explosives the floating
smoke showed rufous and tormented; it was
like the last hour of Gomorrah; one couldn’t
imagine anything left alive there. But it was only
a small local attack—probably a raid by fifty men,
which would be reported in two lines of the G.H.Q.
communique. It would soon be our turn to do
a raid. The Brigadier had made it quite clear that
he ‘wanted a prisoner.’ One would be enough. He
wanted to make certain what troops were in front
of us.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">For identification purposes a dead body would
be better than nothing, Kinjack said. O’Brien
and I went out one moonlight night into a part of
No Man’s Land where there were no mine-craters.
We had been instructed to bring in a dead body
which (so our Observation Officer said) was lying
out there. The Germans had been across the night
before, cutting our wire, and the Lewis-gun officer
was certain that he had inflicted severe casualties
on them. Anyhow, a pair of boots could be seen
sticking up out of a shell-hole. But when we arrived
at the boots we found them attached to the
body of a French soldier who had been there several
months. I didn’t like this much; but O’Brien
whispered to me: “T’Colonel shall have t’boot,”
and the boot, with half a leg on it, was sent down
to Kinjack, as a proof of our efficiency.</p>

<p class="pindent">Prisoners were seldom seen at that time. I
never saw one myself until the Somme battle began
in the summer. The landscape was in front of us;
similar in character to the one behind us, but mysterious
with its unknown quality of being ‘behind
the Boche line.’ We could see the skeleton villages
of Fricourt and Mametz, and the ruinous cemetery
(which the men called ‘the rest camp’). But
the enemy was invisible. On still nights our sleepy
sentries heard him cough from the far side of the
craters. He patrolled, and we patrolled. Often,
when I was crawling about on my belly, I imagined
a clod of earth to be a hostile head and shoulders
watching me from a shell-hole. But patrols
had a sensible habit of avoiding personal contact
with one another. Men in the Tunnelling Company
who emerged, blinking and dusty white, from
the mine-shafts, had heard the enemy digging deep
underground. They may even have heard the
muffled mutter of German voices. But, apart
from the projectiles he sent us, the enemy was, as
far as we were concerned, an unknown quantity.
The Staff were the people who knew all about
him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="line" style="text-align:center;margin-top:.5em;margin-bottom:.2em;font-size:1.5em;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="pindent">Spring arrived late that year. Or was it that
spring kept away from the front line as long as
possible? Up there it seemed as though the winter
would last for ever. On wet days the trees a
mile away were like ash-grey smoke rising from the
naked ridges, and it felt very much as if we were at
the end of the world. And so we were; for that
enemy world (which by daylight we saw through
loopholes or from a hidden observation post) had
no relation to the landscape of life. It had meant
the end of the world for the man whose helmet was
still lying about the trench with a jagged hole
through it. Steel hats (which our Division had
begun to wear in February) couldn’t keep out a
rifle bullet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">By five o’clock on a frosty white morning it
would be daylight. Trees and broken roofs
emerged here and there from the folds of mist that
drifted in a dense blur; above them were the white
shoals and chasms of the sky flushed with the faint
pink of dawn. Standing-to at dawn was a desolate
affair. The men stamped their feet and rats scurried
along the crannied parapets. But we’d had
our tot of rum, and we were to be relieved that
afternoon.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Dandelions had begun to flower
along the edges of the communication trenches.
This was a sign of spring, I thought, as we filed
down Canterbury Avenue, with the men making
jokes about the estaminet in Morlancourt. Estaminet!
What a memory evoking word! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It
was little enough that they had to go back to.</p>

<p class="pindent">As for me, I had more or less made up my mind
to die; the idea made things easier. In the circumstances
there didn’t seem to be anything else to be
done. I only mention the fact because it seems,
now, so strange that I should have felt like that
when I had so much of my life to lose. Strange,
too, was the thought of summer. It meant less
mud, perhaps, but more dust; and the ‘big push’
was always waiting for us.</p>

<p class="pindent">Safe in Morlancourt, I slept like a log. Sleep
was a wonderful thing when one came back from
the Line; but to wake was to remember. Talking
to Joe Dottrell did me good. A new transport officer
had arrived—a Remount man from England.
It was said that he had been combed out of a cushy
job. I was glad I’d given up the transport. Glad,
too, to be able to ride out on the black mare.</p>

<p class="pindent">After the ugly weather in the trenches a fine
afternoon in the wood above Méaulte was something
to be thankful for. The undergrowth had
been cut down, and there were bluebells and
cowslips and anemones, and here and there a wild-cherry
tree in blossom. Teams of horses, harrowing
the uplands, moved like a procession, their
crests blown by the wind. But the rural spirit of
the neighborhood had been chased away by supply
sheds and R. E. stores and the sound of artillery
on the horizon. Albert (where Jules Verne used
to live), with its two or three chimneystacks and
the damaged tower of the basilica, showed above
a line of tall trees along the riverside; a peaceful
medley of roofs as I watched it, but in reality a
ruined and deserted town. And in the foreground
Becourt church tower peeped above a shoulder of
hill like a broken tooth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Anyhow, the black mare had got the better of
the new transport officer. That was something, I
thought, as I jogged home again.</p>

<p class="pindent">My faithful servant Flook always contrived to
keep me supplied with oranges when we were up in
the trenches. An orange, and taking my sodden
boots off whenever I got the chance (though it was
against the rules) were my two favourite recreations
in the front line. Flook called me (with an
orange) at two in the morning; I had to relieve Ormand,
who had been on duty since midnight. The
orange woke me up. But it was a wet night, and
I’d been out with the wiring-party from ten till
twelve. Lugging coils of concertina wire along a
narrow trench swilling with mud and water wasn’t
much fun. Stumbling with it over shell-holes and
trip-wires was worse. However, we had got quite
a lot out.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once I’d shaken off my stupor it wasn’t so bad to
be out in the night air. The rain had stopped and
Ormand had nothing to report. For the next two
hours I should loiter up and down with my knobkerrie
in my hand; now and again I had a whack
at a rat running along the parados. From one
‘bay’ to another I went, stopping for a word in an
undertone with the sentries; patient in their waterproof
sheets they stood on the firestep, peering
above the parapet until bleak daylight began to
show itself. The trench was falling in badly in
places after the rain.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then there was the bombing-post up a sap which
went thirty or forty yards out into No Man’s
Land. Everything had been very quiet, the
bombers muttered.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in the main trench, I stood on the firestep
to watch the sky whitening. Sad and stricken the
country emerged. I could see the ruined village
below the hill and the leafless trees that waited like
sentries up by Contalmaison. Down in the craters
the dead water took a dull gleam from the sky. I
stared at the tangles of wire and the leaning posts,
and there seemed no sort of comfort left in life.
My steel hat was heavy on my head while I thought
how I’d been on leave last month. I remembered
how I’d leant my elbows on Aunt Evelyn’s front
gate (it was my last evening); that twilight, with
its thawing snow, made a comfortable picture now.
John Homeward had come past with his van, plodding
beside his weary horse. He had managed to
make his journey, in spite of the state of the
roads.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He had pulled up for a few minutes,
and we’d talked about Dixon, who had been such
an old friend of his. “Ay; Tom was a good chap;
I’ve never known a better.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He had said
good-bye and good-night and set his horse going
again. As he turned the corner the past had
seemed to go with him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="pindent">And here I was, with my knobkerrie in my hand,
staring across at the enemy I’d never seen. Somewhere
out of sight beyond the splintered tree-tops
of Hidden Wood a bird had begun to sing. Without
knowing why, I remembered that it was Easter
Sunday. Standing in that dismal ditch, I could
find no consolation in the thought that Christ was
risen. I sploshed back to the dug-out to call the
others up for ‘stand-to.’</p>
